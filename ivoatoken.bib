abstract={The Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient Greek astronomical calculator, has challenged researchers since its discovery in 1901. Now split into 82 fragments, only a third of the original survives, including 30 corroded bronze gearwheels. Microfocus X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) in 2005 decoded the structure of the rear of the machine but the front remained largely unresolved. X-ray CT also revealed inscriptions describing the motions of the Sun, Moon and all five planets known in antiquity and how they were displayed at the front as an ancient Greek Cosmos. Inscriptions specifying complex planetary periods forced new thinking on the mechanization of this Cosmos, but no previous reconstruction has come close to matching the data. Our discoveries lead to a new model, satisfying and explaining the evidence. Solving this complex 3D puzzle reveals a creation of genius---combining cycles from Babylonian astronomy, mathematics from Plato's Academy and ancient Greek astronomical theories.},

    abstract = "{The principles on which all modern computing machines are based were enunciated more than a hundred years ago by a Cambridge mathematician named Charles Babbage.’ So declared Vivian Bowden—in charge of sales of the Ferranti Mark I computer—in 1953.1 This chapter is about historical origins. It identifies core ideas in Turing’s work on computing, embodied in the realisation of the modern computer. These ideas are traced back to their emergence in the 19th century where they are explicit in the work of Babbage and Ada Lovelace. Mechanical process, algorithms, computation as systematic method, and the relationship between halting and solvability are part of an unexpected congruence between the pre-history of electronic computing and the modern age. The chapter concludes with a consideration of whether Turing was aware of these origins and, if so, the extent—if any—to which he may have been influenced by them. Computing is widely seen as a gift of the modern age. The huge growth in computing coincided with, and was fuelled by, developments in electronics, a phenomenon decidedly of our own times. Alan Turing’s earliest work on automatic computation coincided with the dawn of the electronic age, the late 1930s, and his name is an inseparable part of the narrative of the pioneering era of automatic computing that unfolded. Identifying computing with the electronic age has had the effect of eradicating pre-history. It is as though the modern era with its rampant achievements stands alone and separate from the computational devices and aids that pre-date it. In the 18th century lex continui in natura proclaimed that nature had no discontinuities, and we tend to view historical causation in the same way. Discontinuities in history are uncomfortable: they offend against gradualism, or at least against the idea of the irreducible interconnectedness of events. The central assertion of this chapter is that core ideas evidenced in modern computing, ideas with which Turing is closely associated, emerged explicitly in the 19th century, a hundred years earlier than is commonly credited.}",

Part 2 provides a brief background on the aims and data access policy of the HapMap Project. Part 3 describes the shortcomings of the HapMap data access policy. Part 4 then proposes an alternative data access policy that preserves some features of the open source approach while also providing enhanced protection against parasitic patenting.}}

    abstract = {Forecasting technological progress is of great interest to engineers, policy makers, and private investors. Several models have been proposed for predicting technological improvement, but how well do these models perform? An early hypothesis made by Theodore Wright in 1936 is that cost decreases as a power law of cumulative production. An alternative hypothesis is Moore's law, which can be generalized to say that technologies improve exponentially with time. Other alternatives were proposed by Goddard, Sinclair et al., and Nordhaus. These hypotheses have not previously been rigorously tested. Using a new database on the cost and production of 62 different technologies, which is the most expansive of its kind, we test the ability of six different postulated laws to predict future costs. Our approach involves hindcasting and developing a statistical model to rank the performance of the postulated laws. Wright's law produces the best forecasts, but Moore's law is not far behind. We discover a previously unobserved regularity that production tends to increase exponentially. A combination of an exponential decrease in cost and an exponential increase in production would make Moore's law and Wright's law indistinguishable, as originally pointed out by Sahal. We show for the first time that these regularities are observed in data to such a degree that the performance of these two laws is nearly the same. Our results show that technological progress is forecastable, with the square root of the logarithmic error growing linearly with the forecasting horizon at a typical rate of 2.5},

abstract = {We introduce a novel conditional e-cash protocol allowing future anonymous cashing of bank-issued e-money only upon the satisfaction of an agreed-upon public condition. Payers are able to remunerate payees for services that depend on future, yet to be determined outcomes of events. Moreover, payees are able to further transfer payments to third parties. Once the payment is complete, any double-spending attempt by the payer will reveal its identity; no double spending by any of payees in the payee transfer chain is possible. Payers cannot be linked to payees or to ongoing or past transactions. The flow of cash within the system is thus both correct and anonymous. We discuss several applications of conditional e-cash including online trading of financial securities, prediction markets, and betting systems.}

abstract = "IF YOU HAVE read about bitcoin in the press and have some familiarity with academic research in the field of cryptography, you might reasonably come away with the following impression: Several decades' worth of research on digital cash, beginning with David Chaum,10,12 did not lead to commercial success because it required a centralized, bank-like server controlling the system, and no banks wanted to sign on. Along came bitcoin, a radically different proposal for a decentralized cryptocurrency that did not need the banks, and digital cash finally succeeded. Its inventor, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, was an academic outsider, and bitcoin bears no resemblance to earlier academic proposals.",

abstract = {Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many challenging issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants’ activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, in which a trustworthy central authority is needed for coordination. Such an approach incurs many disadvantages, including vulnerability to attacks, lack of credibility, and difficulty in calculating rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the abovementioned issues. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods, and techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work comprehensively surveys challenges, solutions, and future directions for blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes: decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed, and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.},
