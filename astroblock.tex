\begin{abstract}

An interoperability  development driver based on (Open) blockchain legdger technology is considered for Astronomy \& Astrophysics Education, Research and Development from K-12 to tertiary-research level to facilitate Astronomy Open Developement as a complimentary system of funding. Funding at least initially to be bootstraped from the decentralized finance movement or DEFI by vetted astronomical institutions with the assumption that DEFI is a key idea of the open blockchain stack providing real solutions when centralized banking and derived limitations in funding and development for Astronomy, may stifle open development in Astronomy. Arguments are given using three salient issues or use-cases: (i) Data Tsunami and Telescope broker systems' that with federated blockchain learning models are expected to provide a complementary method of data information extraction via appropriate incentive mechanisms for large astronomical survey observed, derived value-added or modelled data-sets. (ii) That Astronomical Observatory patrimony has intrinsic historical value to be upheld. (iii) A more level `playing field' is good-practice for science development and so for the advanced of science Astronomers must have similar access to similar resources and if science funding is solely reliant on centralized funding of governements with heavily devalued national currencies then blockchain technological solutions must be recognized and developed, by the community, for the community. Given (i), (ii) and (iii) the challenge then is that the astronomical community build a complimentary and sustainable store-of-value and value-added programmable incentive layer upon open blockchain protocol standards within existing governance structures across institutions. A important corollary: the demonstrably steep decline in the half-life function of US PhD Astronomy majors, measured in public US universities and associated national systems or current brain drain capital flight metric of astronomy majors could be sufficient motivation given the resources required to produce a PhD major in astronomy. More-over, an appropriate blockchain model must be mutable to mitigate other barriers to open development. So in this paper a possible path is set-out including on-boarding one which open development metrics as useful proxies to set potential tokenimics is contemplated, established by the community, automatically monitored and suitably refined possibly through bodies like the IAU and IVOA via public user block-chain ledger governance. 

%Open development metrics eg: Public Lectures by Astronomers from vetted institutions or number of telescope open-nights, H-index, GitHub code-pull/commits, N-body compute capability and usage, you-tube views, etc, graduate student number, could be used to constrain and engineering tokenomics to form the basis of protocol standards. Success of any protocol can be measured by the widespread use so a broad base of people interested in Astronomy but focus initially might be skewed to  public universities that confer astronomical PhD degrees, astronomical facility personal and the open development community in Astronomy. 
%Any alternative successful blockchain based model for the Open Development of Astropny is more likely to be based on the  Nakamoto 2008, Bitcoin protocol, (see whitepaper and standards  defined therein) as well as by other network blockchains that may be more complex. Protocols identified also broadly fall within the Decentralized Finance Movement (DEFI), since funding for Open Development via liquidity pools through grants could be effective. The DEFI movement has been analyzed in other works (REF) to show evidence of being a potential disruptor agent, to several industries including central bank/government issuance of FIAT currency. If the so-called 'sound money' proposition preported by DEFI advocates holds true and FIAT issuance is becoming debased, as shown by some studies, and access to funds for development of Astronomy in some regions also becomes more difficult then community `agreed' Open Development metrics could be used to help the alternative and complimentary funding mechanism of Open Development, based on DEFI liquidity to drive Astronomy, \textbf{our model assumption}. The antithesis that DEFI is a front-running industry that does not have much future for Open Development from which it was born and is not part of a future open protocol stack, a key open-ended question of this study. 

%The so-called Network effect for an open development token for astronomy can only be sustained if it has transaction use for its community.

%Some negative salient features to Open Development that may be present in the standard science funding scheme are analysed and potential metric proxies to Open Development proposed to be evaluated by the community, periodically. Risk factors at World; National; Provincial/State; University level;  etc., of governance are examined and select case-studies presented some of which have led to astronomical communities failing to enter or even maintain international collaborations on global mega-projects or have led to a so-called 'global' brain drain flight of Astronomy PhD majors to other industries, caused interruption of telescope facilities from normal operations or delayed construction of new facilities. 



%A function in smart-contracts could be used to delegate votes from individuals, in governance polls, an example of such code in a ERC20 contract that achieves this is given: UNISWAP-->

%For AstroOP, DEFI liquidity could be sought periodically from Decentralized Exchange(s) eg: Curve Finance, UNISWAP, and other DAO as considered by the community: The case however is that AstroOD be seed funded by DEFI, including UNISWAP Treasury and Education funds, \href{gitcoin grants} {https://gitcoin.co/grants/}, etc.,.  Some final use-case are presented including a case-study to include an NFT series to celebrate aniversary milestones in historic astronomical institutions. An example is given as an NFT series for the 150 year anniversary of the former Argentine National Astronomical Observatory or to mark the historical event of the 1912 Solar Eclipse expedition that set out to constrain Einstein's GTR, led by the then director of the Argentine National Observatory - Perrine 1912, with a message signed by Honorary IAU member and historian Santiago Paolantonio and another case-study of a conference NFT to fund prizes, travel grant unlocks., etc at the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Astronomy's (IATE) Friends-of-Friends Annual Meeting. 

% technology is a natural evolution of The Computer as proposed by Vitalic Buterein then it stands to reason given the tight connection between astronomy and technology that at least in the academic ecosystem such discussion should at least be had. 

%To the end of a Token for Astronomy, basic discussion of a road-map is had in this paper some identifiable issues as protocols for Astronomy "open-development" discussed. 

%Based on some generic smart-contracts. Initially this tech is proposed to have a direct influence on financing and execution of STEM careers  and to revert negative features of the current model that like the Half-life decay of Astronomy PhD majors as determined from statistical studies of US Public Universities. Since the US Public System is large and other similar systems based on it. The current Astronomical Development Model identified to be based on more Centralized Governance that relies on National Fiat Budget approvals, so a feature of our model is that a value-system based on Bitcoin and Ethereum who have each had ROI over the last decade superior to gold or most if not all other asset classes, that the old Meritocratic development Heuristic model often with "Elephant in the room" system failing such as in funding crisis, governement budget warfare, lawfare, debt and crisis that affect directly STEM research and such scientific development is defined to be 'closed' as opposed to 'open'. The old 'closed' heuristic often is often affected by cyclic economic crisis, currency devaluation, unemployment with real affects to the population, such a Heuristic of development challenged in this paper are based on political partism, centralized systems of power giving rise to the Military Industrial Complex, Petro-Dolar inspired drug wars (Chomsky, Understanding Power). Open Blockchain, anti-censoring technology is proposed and in particular through the perspective of thought of a new straw-mans-model as a natural evolution of Astronomy, piggybacked on Open Development Scientific Stack including the fast developing Decentralized Finance Movement, as at worst another useful system to incentivize real value development in Science by programming it to be more open.  

\end{abstract}



% Techniques based on artificial intelligence or machine learning has meant that precise data feeds or meta data eg: IRAF II standard, has shown the importance of synergy between new (Centralized) and optionally (decentralized) Scientific Research endeavour. 
%The current limitation of funding and crisis in Scientific development faced by the foot-soldiers or perhaps someone colloquially described "data slaves" motor of scientific technical development mostly brought to bear by Science Major Career graduates. Since Open Development rests on the Tenets of open source, and given a significant percentage of astronomers use Astropy for some data analysis so we propose an affiliated package of Astropy hereby called astroOD, to be used to create and manage individual wallets and transactions of Fungeble and Non-funagable tokens that serve the Open Developemnt of astronomy.  Although initially astropy users and developers will be onboarded, we propose a staged onboarding setup for successful implementation across the wider astronomical community. Many parts of the tokenomics model are taken directly from the so-called 'decentralized finance' movement that allows for the development of decentralized applications (DApps) on mobile devices to facilitate transactions, transparency and usage of the blockchain via astroOD Tx. This paper investigates possible protocol standards and discusses cross chain technologies via Oracles as a technology applicable to validate transactions and safeguard value via data feeds (Eg ADS searches, citations, etc.) and explores the concept of guardian nodes. General background conditions that motivate adoption by the astronomical community of such a system are presented as some model component parameters. Other technical details are omitted and not fixed but could be be soft or hard-wired after successful vetting from the governance component by means of periodic voting based on staked amounts A staking system is discussed to finance successful projects and  potential governance actors with initial staking claims including members seemingly outside of the astropy development community: Universities, National observatory facilities and institution, amateur astronomical associations, International Astronomy bodies (eg: IVOA, IAU), primary and secondary schooling bodies and other official and unofficial actors that promote astronomy research, education and outreach are discussed..

This white paper examines blockchain as a value optimization and interoperability agent for Astronomy Open Development (AOD). A comprehensive review paper of public and open blockchain ledger technology including the evolution of key ideas, blockchain primitives and protocols that lead-up to the so-called Nakamoto consensus effectively solving the Byzantine Generals problem defined by \cite{Lamport1982TheBG} to forge a store of value in Bitcoin, is treated in  \cite{arvindandclark2017} and references therein. In Fig \ref{fig:narayanan} a key idea of the so-called blockchain based decentralized finance movement is added by adapting fig 1 of \cite{arvindandclark2017}, this idea is dependant on automatic market making smart-contract technology, now added to the figure. Uniswap is also added, identified as a governance token since UNI was the first massive TVL locked DEX 'airdrop' ERC20 token in the history of Blockchain, adding to the decentralized economy, as  revealed by the "Famous String" in the Bitcoin network's genesis block \textrm{coin-base} Dictionary, key/value pair:  'The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks' \footnote{https://hackernoon.com/chancellor-on-brink-of-second-bailout-for-banks-where-to-find-this-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-hm4k34v4}. DEFI as an idea is then recognized as a necesary and complimentary grant funding source or seed funding AOD agent. As AOD blockchain matures, liquidity will no doubt grow and even partake in more general DEFI markets (staking, yield farming, loans, prediction markets, etc). Ultimately any measure of success of an AOD blockchain network will be determined by the wide-spread use of existing astronomers and students, within current structures and institutions. On a related point, Avid Avaryaran points out that the main challenge for wide-spread adoption of decentralized open blockchain ledger technology lies in its utilization by existing users (and institutions) rather than by the adoption of new users from newely forged blockcahin institutions. With this in mind an attempt is made to identify and examine salient issues for blockchain open development for astronomy including use-cases. Since Astronomy development is correlated with software and hardware computer development, so one could argue that this model choice is natural, for example given the growth in programming language in "Full Text" searches and in plethora of papers that use AI methods, so blockchain development for astronomy may surprise us that has heretherto been considered, a model heuristic of this white-paper (WP)  ignored in the context of the data Tsunami, collaborative mega-project era that appear to require use of so-called Astronomy Brokers \cite{bellm19} and other effective Open Development tools.  

This WP starts out discussing the half-life career function \cite{milo_2018} of US PhD Astronomy majors as a broad proxy metric of value for the global market, chosen because of the sheer size of the US research astronomy labour market. This function is trending towards historical lows that as heralded in this paper could be reverted give the resource cost of the PhD astronomy major. So the evolution of this function (metric) alone could be sufficient motivation for the consideration of a complimentary development Blockchain based system for astronomy OD. However, other issues that have lead to artificial barriers in Astronomy \& astrophysics development are also explored. Finally, other STEM communities may also find use in this white-paper since Open Source and Open Development standard protocols appear to experience common data-science constraints and a unifying and converging of methods across different scientific disciplines manifest, so sufficient motivation of blockchain Open Development for other STEM fields may be warranted. %\cite{GITTER2008529} to prevent closed patent licensing] or Pandemic COVID 'data-science'.

%In the last dozen years any community that built its value system on top of the Open Public Ledger stack that itself is based on The Bitcoin Standard Protocol would be wiser for it. In this paper, an attempt is made to bring to light into the debate interesting Blockchain primitives that have been largely unexplored but based on Open Source Development, to fork to existing protocols to promote interoperability through data-feeds, no doubt equivalent to  "ADS, Journal pub", IVOA protocols, etc identified in our case for Astronomy, to be seeded through "open-development", by the Community for the Community and through Layer 2 decentralized governance solutions.

%Potentially Blockchain technology for open development will continues to be more important so it could be argued that "Computer Systems" hardware and software will continue t evolve because of Blockchain, as shown in ASIC hardware development, increase in Pico Hashes per second surpassing Moore's Law and by the fact that Blockchain technology is is heralded by its proponent as disrupting the global financial system as evidenced since the first Bitcoin Block and through the last decade. 


%One of the problems of `Astropysics' which was an astronomy python package maintained by Eric Tollerud who is one of the OG of Astrpy, was that although projects were open there where many developers that maintained their own packages and had functions that often were similar or if not the same. This meant that less than efficient development of code could take place. 

%In an TCG IVOA meeting. Erik presented some evidence that IVOA development is sometimes a bit skewed to the big projects like ESA, astrogrid (UK), perhaps two of the most influential International Members of IVOA. These projects even design space-born telescope/instruments with multi-billion dollar buldgets. Unfortunately at times some of the standards that emerge are not exactly optimal for the communtiy most of which (70 percent, Tollerud) as shown in a recent poll work as data analysis using Python and the astronomical libraries of Astropy.

%Any complementary base layer model must be able to react to systemic risk factors to open development and sufficiently robust to build-up immunity to mitigate against counter-party risks that could be rooted in Financial; Health (Pandemics) ; or other political motivations that hinder Open Development in Astronomy. Some case-studies are discussed.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%
 The Antikythera mechanism was found in 1901 from the debris of a ship-wreck that were estimated to have occurred about two thousand years earlier. Computer \& Data Scientists on average recognize it to be the first analogue computer mechanism or simply put: The Computer. \citet{Freeth2021} and other studies have demonstrated that the Antikythera mechanism was designed to solve mostly astronomical problems based on a technology that rested on much support from the ancient Greek Astronomers, including Hipparchus and Archimedes. The detailed scanning and modelling of the relic 'jig-saw puzzle' by \citet{Freeth2021} reveal that it contained at-least three finely crafted rotating discs and more than thirty-odd cogs that were designed, forged and crafted with adequate tolerances to calculate and predict the positions of important astronomical sources including The Sun; The Moon; and some planets, across time; calculations necessary for navigation, agriculture, cultural and scientific/technological reckonings and human development.
 
 The Ancient Greek astronomers had defined the magnitude logarithmic system and introduced concepts of limits and infinitesimals in geometry that would become the basis of differential calculus, and numerical methods that have become the mainstay of open source tool-kits for the development of astronomy, see Figure 1 of \cite{2022arXiv220614220T}.
 
 It is now known after a plethora of multi-disciplinary studies including that of \citet{Freeth2021} that during the decline of Ancient Greece the first analogue "Computer" was temporally `lost' to most of the technological world, and only in the fourteen century comparable `advanced' mechanisms where developed in Astronomical clock machinery in Europe. 
 
 Now, more than two-thousand years hence, Alan Turin (AT) is widely recognized as a modern father of The Computer, for his pioneering  work in the twentieth century that paved the foundations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cryptography. 
 
Cryptography is the basis of Open blockchain ledger technology, a technology that until now has not been much considered for astronomy development, least as a potential interoperability catalyzing agent. Cryptography for Astronomy has been restrrcited for used as a tool for data compression, limited data permission (rights) and some related data fidelity issues.


Conversely,  `Machine-learning' and `Data Mining' Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are found in a plethora of published studies in astronomy and astrophysics peer-reviewed journals. Some of these studies depend on AI to: estimate the physical parameter spaces of sources from large ensembles of data measurements of the observable parameter space; classify sources and astrophysical relations or laws that govern The Universe. AI technology is proving fundamental in the so-called data-tsunami era of astronomy and data-science, since mega-surveys have requirements that must consider Velocity, Volume, Veracity, and Variety of data; each providing constraints set for the optimization of data-science. High cadence astrophysics events for example through multi-messenger observations are required to study kilonova transients that depend on real-time AI alert systems and have recently revealed from Kilonova, specto-photometric modelling that rapid neutron capture, or r-process, nucleosynthesis, requires dense, neutron-rich material as measured by  the ejecta produced by the collision of two neutron stars, see \cite{artola2020}. AI is playing a fundamental role in the evolution of Astronomy, including gravitational wave, radio (eg: SKA) and optical (eg: Vera Rubin). Most of these systems use Open Source technology. Due to the shear data volumes and storage costs, the fear is that data streams may soon not be preserved entirely, least, easily accessible for reprocessing. For example for the Vera Rubin surveys data is pre-processsed is injested into seven Brokers that have been selected in an open call, but most represent groups that are highly weighed with expertise from specific fields or areas of astrophyics. Brokers do the source-matching. Most brokers if not all use Open Source software. However, a corollary arises. Could the data-streams use open blockchain protocols to protect data provenience and perhaps to unite brokers across different wavelengths and AI learning methods and models. Blockchain is proposed in this white paper to be a missing link for Astronomy (Open) Development, in an environment where the half-life function of PhD majors in astronomy is exponentially decreasing and projects are becoming much more reliant on team science.  The vera Rubin telescope has enough bandwidth and resources for only full data streams to 7 `community Brokers' which have been defined: Alerce, Ampel, Antares, Babamul, Fink, Lasair, Pitt-Google. Could DEFI be used to fund a dedicated Astropy community Broker, rewarded via Oracles for soft-ware and data analysis contributions? Decentralized Science funding or DESCI via existing governance structures like IVOA could be used to mitigate these as well as others stifling effects  on open development. 

\emph{Our goal then is to discuss Public Open Blockchain (cryptographic) technology and identify useful elements for a base-layer stack for the Open Development of Astronomy.}

\section{Blockchain Review}
\label{sec:bc_review}
\cite{arvindandclark2017} show insurmountable evidence as do many other authors therein that standard open blockchain protocols are much rooted in academic studies. Fig \ref{fig:narayanan} is an adaptation of fig1 of \citet{arvindandclark2017} with an additional key-idea made explicit: The "Decentralized Finance Movement" and the decentralized blockchain decentralized exchange (DEX) providing that rests on the Bitcoin Nakamoto consensus. The DEX permits automatic market making Swap contract and incentive for liquidity providers. The Txs contracts should ideally be automatically executed without the threat of any third party. Initially developed to omit the need of a centralized order book,  but other counter party risks to contract execution for example web server failure, (see INFURA DNS attack to Oracle: stable coin Ethereum counter party risk), must also be mitigated if true decentralization is designed. Governence and voting must also be contemplated. Nevertheless for this whitepaper, UNISWAP is chosen, selected as above as an initial funding revenue source and UNI as its governance token \href{https://github.com/Uniswap}{UNISWAP}, since it was the first decentralized exchange (DEX) including automatic market making technology that also issued a massive governance air-drop that to date is amongst the largest liquidity drops in history whose treasury has more the 3 billion USD in TVL. Note: The advent of smart-contracts is attributed to Nick Szabo who first proposed contracts as a blockchain primitive of sorts, unrelated to AI but more aligned to automatic conditional P2P transaction conditioning that does not even require human intervention, can be machine to machine but automatically executes in the cloud, and does not require any third party involvement, perhaps based on a "trustless" financial rail system like the Nakamoto consensus' Bitcoin network. More detailed on DEX can be found in \cite{uniswap2019_angeris} who explore technical details of Uniswap and its use as a financial DEFI source.

Following Szabo in \href{https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html}{community vetted smart contract OD protocols} could integrate into base-layer applications like Oracles to automatically injest data from third-party data-feeds like ADS publication rates within a research subject, field, key area,  or even institution.

This paper starts out by assuming the Nakamoto Consensus of blockchain from the white-paper of \cite{nak2009} and subsequent Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) forms a base layer store-of-value for AOD. A review of the Bitcoin standard can be found in \citet{Hansen2020Book}. However as basic justification for this choice some properties of Bitcoin as a valid and sound store of value base-layer system include the following: its proof-of-work consensus algorithm for security, it was the first open blockchain network, has remained the top blockchain via market-cap, includes a block-size constraint that allow full-nodes to be run even on a single PC, its supply function is capped at $21\,000\,0000$, and new blocks dependent on miner rewards and two-week difficulty adjustment, as well as other technology incorporated over its history of life via bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs). Moreover, since its inception in 2009 and after 12 years of price action (see Fig 1) it has proved to be a valid store-of-value with an ROI far superior to the USD. Although as noted, on short time-scales, (less than a year) the BTC price (in USD) is volatile, on-chain analysis indicates that over time volatility is decreasing and although the BTC/USD pairing is somewhat also correlated to global financial markets (Lyn Alden) and inherent volatility yet on longer time-scales BTC volatility as measured by Cohen et al. and other authors has been measured to be falling. 

The latest L2 BIP update occured at the end of 2021 and includes smart contract capability through the TAP-ROOT extension that has made the network more scalable (to get around the limitation of the 10-min average block node confirmation), and the earlier Lightning BIP built necessarily on-top of Segwit, is more than enough for smart-contract Tx requirements for AOD applications nevertheless other, less secure open blockchain protocols as mentioned  offer advantages in funding and fuctionality including scalability and Tx costs. Market cap, ease of use, developer numbers, technology standards, cross chain metric analysis, as well as other indicators for other L1 chains must be considered including Ethereum, DOT, LTC, chains. Many of these alt chains have helped in the technology development of Bitcoin network. The LTC group of core-developers for example have helped develop Lightning. Many alt L1 have thriving developer communities, DApps and billions of USD in locked liquidity and are part of the burgeoning Decentralized Finance Movement, whose primitive protocols may offer advantages for AOD and seed-funding from DEFI grant funds. 

We set-out on the issue of on-boarding and seed funding following the DEFI heuristic whilst focusing on target use-case, possible requirements, metrics and other implementation issues following \cite{20d30b4efb014b21b7ab27f5218692ab} who have argued that the main challenge facing widespread use of public open blockchain technology, lies in on-boarding existing users within existing institutions, so in Section XX a straw-person concept map of the Astronomical Observatory of Cordoba/IATE is dissected for blockchain within its various sub-units departments, research groups, programs, educational, academic etc., including "Telescopio Itinerante", "Noche de los Museos", "Museum del Observatorio Astronomico", "Library", "FOF workshop" are identified. The IATE-OAC has over 80 staff including permanent academic staff, graduate and undergraduate students,  CPA (Technical and auxiliary staff) all which make up an otherwise thriving ecosystem. It is argued that for successful open protocols in Astronomy, incentive system must be worked-out within these units to allow for liquidity partitioning to direct to Open Development despite otherwise hindrance in funding challenges given the existing funding system.

Smart contract first coined by Nick Szabo have nothing to do with AI but instead related to the concept of automatic conditional P2P transactions that obviate requirement of a third party that may more often than not be a centralized entity. Smart contracts may be  automatically executed by one or several parties. According to a \href{https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html}{community vetted smart contract protocols} are useful data-stuctures for open blockchain development that have applications including Oracles that could involve tokens and nodes that validate transaction and receive data from external data feeds. Thse could be useful to adjudicated resources using community established metrics that may include publication rate in international refereed peer-reviewed journals or as  a research subject or field, group or institution, including macro metrics like GDP increase towards science and development could be taken as  valid metrics. 

Governance protocols based on smart-contracts are identified as part of potentially successful AOD infrastructure, since the voice of the community may be efficiently instructed;  actions decided via voting etc; Prediction market protocols could also be used to help AOD mitigate against stochastic ill-effects that may cause restrictions to Open development caused by other status-quo 'hard-wired" funding mechanisms. For example in Sec XXX we examine the TFlop computational issue facing Argentine Astronomers (mostly N-body, and Grid), in which HPC Argentine Research Scientist are at a disadvantage since TFlop capability as much technology is priced in USD. So delays of years to obtain project money to start building HPC infrastructure put Argentine Astronomers on an uneven playing-field. In Fact, it was stated in the Jornadas de Computation de Astronomia de Argentina (Nov 2021)  in which the IATE invited members across all the astronomical institutions for a workshop, that pooling resources is necessary but not sufficient because of rising capital costs to to UPC, air-conditioning, rising energy costs, network core infrastructure costs, so research projects often have to be scaled back to front-up these costs or depend on external (closed-to-others) collaborations infrastructure. In Fig 2 we reproduce the historic global crisis function of nation states that depicts an exponential increase in crisis instances during periods when `sound money' was  unfamiliar to most governments of the world. It is concurrently noted that these periods affected and retarded astronomy open development since in those times other more essential funding priorities dominate including using available funding to cover the bare essential necessities of the population. We emphasize from this figure that during the Bretton Woods accorded period, or the period within the de-marked broken blue lines that the occurrence of financial crisis was approximately a global minimum. 

Could the Nakamoto consensus as the go-to store of value or sound money base protocol and subsequent BIPs usher-in a new period of stability and even innovation for OAD in Astronomy? 

In Fig 3 we reproduce the empirical half-life function for astronomy and astrophysics PhD majors as well as other STEM fields within the US Public University System. It is clear that this figure is shows alarming exponential rate of decline.  In Section \ref{sec:btc2}, discussion of the current and historical situation that has underpinned the negative effects of Astronomy development with examples are discussed. In Section  \ref{sec:btc3}, some blockchain primitives and protocols are identified, selected to complement Open Astronomy Development.  In Section \ref{sec:btc4} a simple idea of implementation and on-boarding for our model of Astronomy education/development and research via open development is proposed via Astropy, the leading Open Developer community tool-kit by Astronomers for astronomers. In Sec. \ref{sec:btc5} conclusions drawn and some discussion on a possible future course of action plus an NFT case-study to celebrate 150 years of the Observat\'orio Astron\'omico de Cordoba, the former National Argentine Observatory. 

\section{Open Astronomy development}
\label{sec:btc2}

In this Section we propose 5 use-cases for blockchain as case-studies. Chosen across a wide base-line of variety for Astronomy development at the OAC-IATE identified as infrastructure for (i) funding of a new telescope-system TOROS at an ELT tested site, (ii) 'telescopio itinerante' or itinerant telescope program of the OAC, (iii) re-value historical OAC patrimony, (iv) grant stable coin liquidity pool for granted research projects, that is PICT-PIP, (v) Broker for backend of Vera Rubin Survey. 

Although case-types identified mostly focus on  the OAC-IATE, due to more generalized systematic crisis in funding that affects OAD at the global scale so in this context in this section some global salient issues are also examined, including the so-called global brain drain or haemorrhage afflicting astronomers. In Subsection \ref{btc2:sec:sub:half} proxy metrics for AOD are proposed that might go someway to restore historic half-life rate function of Astronomy PhD majors in Public US Universities and associated AOD systems as considered. 

Vera Rubin Surveys 10,000 alerts provided every 39 seconds. Need short time-scale science. Semantically rich alert. Triggering Difference Imagine source, 82 KB per alert means 5 GB per s per full stream. Sixty Second from read-out information needs to get to the Broker system, at least 5 full streams to alert brokers.   For example  Jakob Nordin of AMPEL, requests from the community a standard processing framework for Legacy Very Rubin data, a standard that would enable processing of data-sets irrespective of broker identically and as efficiently as possible, at the moment this is a challenge.  Mathew Graham of Babamul considers that traditional approaches to handle event streams are sub-optimal and sees for back-end work a decentralized network of low-cost components employing commodity AI accelerators and reusable models plus an in-use science data platform for information management that any group can set up on their own at-scale broker for less than 1 USD per day, using Raspberry PI + USB TPUs (4 TOPS), optimal for deep learning models.  Federated Learning for example, which is what Babamul is attempting that is completely open sourced, could well complement open block chain protocols implementation. Several issues exist for federated learning systems including single-point failure type issues, but also a suitable incentive mechanism to mitigate against data falsification. Blockchain-enabled federated learning can solve these issues as described in 


\subsection{Half-life function}
\label{btc2:sec:sub:half}

The exponentially falling half-life function for Astronomy majors in US public universities is an alarming metric. It is now about 3 years and has been dropping exponentially since about 1970 or about the same time the US withdrew unilaterally from the International Bretton-Woods accords that tied the 'price of one USD' to an allocation of gold. The desertion PhD function could be considered a global hemorrhage of 'grey matter' or capital flight away from astronomy open development.

\emph{In an open development model scientific contributions from the community should be guaranteed, valued and enhanced in a P2P application-layer sense via a more robust gold2.0-standard programmed by the community through open governance blockchain protocols.}


\subsection{The Merging of Open-Source protocols}

Both AI and Blockchain cryptographic come from Open Source community and both may actually be necesary for the evolution of Astronoomy. To help resolve the issue that is presented by the Data Tsunami, on building deep learning models for large data streams, brokers are necessary, and must be as efficient as possible. For surveys like the Vera Rubin the tasks are complex from cross matching to managing to the community deep learning models to test and refine. Data-rights proprietary periods although have been dropping over time and are now around 6-12 months obviously provide science-team members with a considerable time-sensitive advantage and know-how first mover advantage.  Given the scenario depicted in \label{btc2:sec:sub:half} of increasing number of astronomer PhDs within larger team projects, and considering as reported by the Bambanunu broker team, for deep federated learning decentralized computer infrastructure is expected to be more ideal than large centralized data-centres for many types of problems.  Astronomers that don't have access to such infrastructure to train a models either with their own machines and drawn know-how or are not part of a federated deep learning model will find it more difficult to stay competitive. Blockchain technology could help here too in incentivizing colaboration.   

How to merge Open Blockchain technology to Open Source academic/(community) stack of astronomy protocols via the: Nakamoto Consensus?

In the last decade Open-Source projects in Astronomy have burgeoned and become somewhat unified. 'Astropy' with its community affiliated and coordinated packages has become the leading community repository mine.  One of the reasons the community got behind one project was that many packages offered similar functions and the maintenance costs scaled with the number of version. Some methods may have been more optimal, so a standard system evolved that now maintains the code-base in the community. In Astropysics and other early python repositories for Astronomy the developers recognized with other members of the community that community maintained code repositories was key to development of Open-Source software.

It is contemplated in this White Paper perhaps some-what heuristically that like The Computer that has continued to be a fundamental tool for astronomical problem solving, Blockchain that is itself derived from open source community efforts warrants a more complete analysis by the comunity for AOD. Although most astronomers use Astropy amongst other tools, no block chain modules yet exist on Astropy so we on balance of a community coordinated or affiliated package, consider AstroOD as a coordinated package, since interoperability of coordination is required with other actors and agents of facilities including the IVOA 
\subsection{Liquidity Tooling}
\label{btc2:sec:sub:liquidity}
Adding and protecting value in Astronomy, for Open Development inevitably requires so-called 'liquidity tooling'. Liquidity tooling is the engineering of liquidity mechanisms and tools, that extend on the Nakamoto Consensus. Fortunately several decentralized framework solutions to perusing a balanced economy for the open development of astronomy are being development and Web3 + Web2= Web5 solutions will no doubt eventually evolve as bitcoin L2 scaling solutions develope. DEXs for example like Uniswap Labs could be natural systems that aside from provide a grant are developing NFT ERC20 aggregator so on-balance NOVA in Argentina and the OAC is starting up a blockchain program to this end.

One tooling mechanism could be to define metrics by the existing governance's institutions to enable Open Astronomical development funding.
\subsection{Funding Framework}

Here we identify possible AOD funding frameworks, all from crypto asset classes.  It is argued that Decentralized Finance (DEFI) based grant funding is identified currently as the most useful.

Figure 1 shows the financial crisis recorded about the Bretton Woods accords, when US unilaterally pulled out.

Before Bitcoin some initial attempts of a digital currency yielded successful prosecutions by the US Fed court system vaguely under the term: 'Counterfit' of the legal tender or of the Fiat currency system.

\section{Early protocols}
\label{sec:btc3}

Early store-of-value protocols preceding BITCOIN are discussed in Chaum (1983), Chaum, Fiat Naor (1989), Rivest and Shamir (1997). Haber and Stornetta (1991) discuss the notion as an important driver for global scientific, social and cultural growth that with 5G promises to rival the historic highs of 18 \% of World annual GDP of the likes not seen since the first industrial revolution (Walden et al. CTO of NOKIA, Bell's 2018 speech).

If Bitcoin/Blockchain is a decentralized technology, its use as a store-of-value for Astronomy must complement decentralized education, research, and development. This is embodied in its name-sake, so-called term: "Open Development".

The first decade of the 21st century gave rise to the Bitcoin standard, published anonymously by Satashi Nakamoto in 2008.  In the first block, see Figure 1: Satoshi made reference to the New York Times article that reported that the then U.K. chancellor was considering a second Bail-out round of the largest UK Banks. Satoshi, probably a pseudonym is demonstrated to have been from the academic literature since Satoshi much cites the academic literature. That according to some analysis may represent the work from mostly one individual (MOOC BlockChain, Princeton), although definative evidence remains ellusive perhaps the event if some of the early Wallets of Satoshi which have not been touched are transfered to another wallet, then Satoshi's identify may become a little less elusive. Moreover this is  mostly a mute point to this discussion, since the academic cordon has thereto proven in the cited references of \cite{nak2009}. Never-the-less Bitcoin and it's Blockchain network and bitcoin the asset has been successfully argued to have grown in value over all other asset classes, including gold, so it could be argued that so far, in the time-frame of years in it's first decade of existence the Store-of-value proposition appears to be a sound one.

In shorter time-frames (days or a few months) BTC volitility is significantly higher. Some models find that since it to be a measurably young asset class, this adds to volatility, and so it tends to be more sensitive to external speculative financial capital markets, and yet as a commodity asset has been designed to have diminishing volatility with increasing time-scale (years, decade), asset (Antonopoloulos)? Energy Usage is also discussed here in Section \Section{energy}. 
 
BTC as a world reserve still appears to be partly correlated to other global financial markets. A recent example is the Covid19 black Thursday pandemic that in March 2020 saw BTC price drop by more than 30\% in only a few hours. This appeared to be triggered by the Black Thursday liquidity crisis that swept the much larger global financial markets and the reactions of central bank governments to it as did the Omicron crash of December 2021. The March 2020 crash coincided with a crash in global equity markets that saw stocks suffer the worse losses since The Great Depression" and iconic corporations were "bailed out", like Hertz after a record number of unemployed, filed for unemployment benefits in the US. After about a fortnight, like many blue-chip stocks, bailed out by the US FED via Repo, corporate bond offers, and share buy-backs the BTC recovered almost instantly. Against other asset classes including gold and USD, BTC appears to be in the short scales at worst, as volatile. 
 
Bitcoin as a technology to solve several problems faced by earlier digital currencies. Having no single point of failure meant law suits can not be used to persecute anonymous creators. This adds to network security by processing Hash functions which is adjusted on a two week basis. Some authors, including Andreas Antonopoulos believe Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains have the potential to revolutionize open development in science and technology and with 5G roll-out promise unprecedented levels of growth of over 18 percent per year, not seen since the first industrial revolution Waldon, M.  Fig needtoinsertfigure adapted from Walden et al. shows the world GDP as a function of time. These technologies were born out of academia, the occupy wall-street and anonymous movements as a direct response to the 2008 financial crisis that saw a global slump in the world GDP based on the US sub-prime financial crisis  that included a drop in US GDP by 30 \% sustained over several years.
 
Programmable money is not exclusively relevent to human beings but also to machines as particapative actors. Hardware evolution is also tied to open development, as seen in the evolution of specialized hardware architecture for Proof Of Work (POW) HASH Function calculations that is developing Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICS) to mine Bitcoin blocks. It could be argued that these developements have outpaced Moore's law.  Wrights Law suggests that the for every percentage increase in the cumulative distribution function of production in any industry equates to a fixed percentage increase in the efficiency of production. So hardware has evolved from CPU intense through to graphic processing units (GPU) and  Application Specific Integrated Circuit  (ASICS), \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0052669}. A successful model for Astronomy and Astrophysics Open Development would do good to tie metrics of Open Production into the protocol as well as the appropriate incentive mechanism.       

Open Blockchains are uncensored so a data protocol standard of best practice through governance could be cross validated from an information criterion perspective that includes Oracle feeds for Open Development.  Oracles that receive feeds are penalized if they predict incorrect probability distributions of events or Facts for Astronomy Development prediction markets. 

\section{Early Blockchains}
Turing complete programming languages like ETH (ref to Vitallic) but unlike BITCOIN  (refernce to Satoshi) have loops and are able to iterate infinitely.  Bitcoin was purposely built to be much simpler, it has proven in just over a decade (see Fig \ref{fig:btc}) to be a good store of value when compared to the USD. It does not deal naively with Smart Contracts. Although Ethereum can do much of what Bitcoin can, its scope is far larger than simply being a digital, decentralized global store of value mechanism of human transactions. Whereas Bitcoin was primarily designed to be a P2P form of electronic cash, the Ethereum blockchain was designed to also function as a “World Computer”. There are many excellent sources in the Literature on this but we will concentrate on Atributes of a Token for Astronomy in the Section below and describe aspects of our model.

\section{Indexing Open Production and Development}

A community defined and validated AOD system could be used to evaluate preferred funding channels including node validation via incentives Txn types. Such a system could be periodically revised by the community with community governance protocols that ideally would respect yet complement existing structures in a self-consistent decentralized manner. IVOA could be the perfect example with 19 Nation State member countries and 4 international members. These metrics could be used to direct and supply liquidity for the Open Development of Astronomy. As seen in Fig Seffanni. national governments that spend a larger percentage of GDP towards science and technology also on average have higher GDP growth rates (in USD). So this could be a weighting factor metric. See equtation1. Reciprocal percentage of total GDP towards science could be a constructed normalization parameter. So too could total debt to GDP public debt.  An example is the Maker ERC231 ETH governance token that itself control a  pseudo-decentralized US stable coin bank, DAI, over-collateralised that has remained 1 USD for several years despite the BTC market varience.  On the question of whether a special token need minting. The pros and cons need to be carefully studied by the community. For example WETH and WBTC are stable tokens that are on native ETH but allow interconectivity between chains. A similar system occurs with the price issuance of DAI via Maker. It is an important element of DEFI and governence that is included in Figure 2.   

DEFI protocols and more general community may have some motivation to provide decentralized funding for astronomy Open Development. First, Open development protocols could insure existing methods and procedures mauy also be applicable to the Open Development of Astronomy Community. Both  based on Open Source technology, that follow the Lindy effect.
 
 \section{Model Attributes of a Token for Astronomy}
\label{sec:btc4}
There are certainly advantages if the community has its own token. But there are also disadvantages. RSA Ecliptic Curve Algorithm, asymetric hash function, Blind, Schnor Signatures, Merkle Trees, ZKP,  WEB3, Multi-sig, Cross chain, mixing - Privacy. 

\subsection{Block Validation}
\label{subsec: validator}
Blockchain Validators and Nodes. ERC20 Protocalls like GRT ERC   

\href{https://defipulse.com/}{DEFI$\;$ PULSE} pulse is a list of all the liquidity that is tied into DEFI. There is over 77.77 $\times 10^{9}$ USD locked in DEFI. The UNISWAP treasury has in excess of 3 billion dollars. These treasury funds are available via grants programs that Astronomy Open Development protocols should have access to.

In this Section, a toy model for the open development of Astronomy based on open Blockchain technology is presented. An attempt is made to sketch out ingredients and methods of a `successful' model. Some elemental principals as voted by governance should be voted at different stages calibration proposals. For argument sakes in this model we follow the UNISWAP snapshot community, where there are different instances of governance. We also have a treasury funds, and the like.  through governance solutions. The UNISWAP model, to date is one of the largest decentralized exchange, has many developers working for it, was the first massive airdrop token of blockchain value, so is essentially decentralized in our assumption. The funds for this Paper come from DEFI, from the NOVA node of the IVOA-EXEC committee for Argentina. Some fundamental actors are identified and their functionality with the model sketched out. This paper does not pretend to discuss in strict technical details the finer points of the implementation of such model and parameters therein, but does make reference to some basic cryptographic primatives including Merkle Trees, Zero-knowledge proofs, cross chain protocals, etc. that offer promising solutions and could certainly be considered to be incorporated during Improvement Proposals directed by the community periodically. The paper does not delve into technical details of some blockchain procedures like mixing to maintain secure personal and private information but of all actors but pretends to highlight some core model features to be followed up by future authors but obviously  locked value will naturally flow to the more useful protocols.  
 
The only condition to participate is bonafide scientific curiosity for Astronomy so sufficient incentive methods need to be developed to entice value-added interaction with the astronomy blockchain via Decentralized Block Chain Applications, (DAps) as programmable parameters that can be set by the Model's governance component albeit individual minority actors. 

%This part examines a type of Model. The ICO era based on the Ethereum smart contracts bubble that burst aside from rthe egulatory issues about Securities that was mostly based on near useless speculative tokens must be avoided by any AOD bonafide . It looks at some main or speculive  I would not be in favour of an ICO, I think founds are complimentary and as such must come forom existing DEFI protocol pools. But the Community must decide this. However, For the sake of simplicity the following three `actors' are identified as founding governance members: International Virtual Observatory Alliance, the  Astropy community and authors of referred peer reviewed journals weighted by their h-index, the International Astronomy Union etc. Parameters such as the weight of each should be set soon and be discussed by the community and there could even be a switch or that must be voted on according to community established acoords. For example astropy community. A type of switch could be voted for to change the relative percentage of votes.UNISWAP for exmaple is the first governence token that inclduded the AMM liquidity  The reward will be the AstroOD Token, since the wallet creation, blockchain exploder and DApp python tools and protocols are unified by the proposed affiliated package of astropy. This parameter could be considered to as a proportionality of any initial coin distribution function. But we would be against this and think programs need to start from the ground-roots up, providing liquidity and rewarding Tx were useful (community validaded) Tx occur. On Balance an initial token distribution or ICO has drawbacks and so our model draws on existing liquidity pools from the DEFI Space.

Over 70 percent of Astronomers use  Astropy and recent paper in preparation show a promising metric in developer community as the community developer toolkit for Open Source code, that with VO software makes up the majority toolkit of astronomers barring some HPC computing for N-body simulations. Many astronomers probably agree to say these would be the recognized go-to  Astronomy Software and Development so the Astropy Community onboarding, usefulness would be advantages to the Open Development Astronomy model (here-after ODM) of Astronomy as proposed. Affiliated package authors could be validated and offered a period to open a wallet and partake in governence DAO. An affiliated package to Astropy is selected to generate private public SHA256 pairs and the generated funds will be locked by the Community 70 percent to Developers. 

No initial coin offering is neesary as this would be deemed a securtiy and may violate some Legal Juristicitions that we argue for Open Development must be lawful yet, at the same time decentralized means if a majority want and if safeguards are put in place, ie truelly decnentralized nodes, not INFURA WEB three but above. So recognizing `challanges' that Open Protocol must face and converging on Wrights Law of the CDF of Astronomy Developement we appeal to DEFI grant protocols to fund our development. 


The AstroOD package 

We propose an AstroOD coordinated package \textcolor{red} github ref. that periodically receives data-feeds on AstroOD on collects basic statistics of packages being used and is correlated to ADS Main-Text query and ORCID query. A possibility is to build a SubGraph to program as an Oracle on UNISWAP. UNISWAP liquidity    Anyone in the Astropy community can create key pairs to be used as Smart Contract accounts. The program using RSA, and blind signature for privacy. The package will include a functional wallet, with multi signature, multi currency and multiple accounts. This will be the basis of deployment of “Smart Contracts”, as a concept was introduced in 1995 by Nick Szabo, who described Smart Contracts as “a set of promises,
specified in digital form, including protocols within which these parties perform.

AstroOD package will have to be built to implement the use of Oracles, to connect the community to the blockchain space. Oracles manage feeds of information are not put into the native blockchain due to scalability or privacy issues, etc but to other Chains.  Oracles are more focused on price-feed data for crypto asset prediction markets but with DEFI burgeoning and necessity the Oracle inputs are becoming more diversified.  The Oracle Problem 4 promises” (Szabo, 1996). 

Feeds for Oracles would include ADS-NASA, ArchieX ., etc,  to validate information that can be used to automatically set parameters in the model. The weights could be voted on by IVOA representatives.

If the  model truly represents an open blockchain then anyone can participate and be offered rewards as incentive in pursuit of open astronomy. It is obviously important that protocol standards be defined and a body like IVOA could be instrumental in helping to define them with the Astropy community, for example. That body could take into account validaded economic considerations like inflation of national currencies., crisis, etc. Staked AstroOD tokens can be awarded using a 'competative' awards scheme program to Secondary School Teachers, Plenetarium guides, thesis graduate students etc. that work to teach astronomy. All must have oportunity to receive incentive rewards for their valid contributions including for example validated University students and volunteers that mount Open-Day/Night activity for the public, etc., All should receive incentive rewards for their contribution since sacrificing their time in sharing knowledge to allow others opportunities should be rewarded as it is clearly in pursuit of Open Development. Weightings for these activities can be set periodically by the governance component with mandatory revision periods, and clauses if they change too abruptly. An option is to follow MakerDAO governance models, with funds from Treasury. Unfortunately political, financial, health  crisis cause by rampant financial speculation and the like, will probably not be solved by Central Bank Digital Currencies, as these are essentially still centralised institutions on a blockchain.  Often during these crisis outreach and educational activities are the first casualty of open development, as are essential and scares resources for Public University and National Institute research bodies. In the case of the creation of events, the governance model will award staked token holder to provide credit for future open development. Authors who publish papers also may claim awarded tokens and trade them too?

\subsection{Digital Open Ledger Technology}

\subsection{ERC 721 }

ERC 721 tokens are an ETH standard token contracts that are Non-Fungible Token (NFT), ie they are unique and indivisible or in other words can be used to identify a unique event, object or condition. This type of Token may be used on platforms that offer digital collectibles, access keys, lottery tickets, numbered seats for concerts, sports matches or academic meetings, for example best "student" poster prizes in conferences, etc. 

ERC 721 tokens may have different values from one another although derived from the same Smart Contract base, due to its age, rarity often iconized by its unique visual artistry (appearance).

The uint256 variable or called tokenId, so for any ERC-721 Contract, the pair contract address, uint256 tokenId must be globally unique. Said that a dApp can have a "converter" that uses the tokenId as input and outputs an image of something cool, like zombies, weapons, skills or amazing kitties!


With PAOP protocol ERC721 SMart Contract Non-Fungable Tokens can be issued on demand if needbe. These digital collectables will be sold on a Dex funded exchange, to provide liquidity to further Scientific-Cultural usecases.

i) A PhD scholarship holder has run out of PhD Funding 
ii) A Group that is working in some country has had the USD devalued and the subsidy payments are late, and they are applying for some tokens and offer in exchange a collaborate NFT to be published in the acknolodgements of the paper.
iii) A group of astronomers, technicians, students,  are building an observatory in a advantageous site in a poor country. 

\subsection{Tokenisation}

Since centralized regulation that at some stage may undermine public open Blockchain science development and by weighing-up pros/cons between POW and POS consusus, of the Table blockpros/cons as well as from recognizing the 12 year dominance of BITCOIN we choose to follow governance model tokenisation, adopted by  companies like "Shape-Shift" a XXX billion USD companies that has become completely Tokenized. Any system must be able tp use Bridges even to different chains. 

Its xxx workers were each given some tokens as where select members from the community. 

A possible route of course is to solicit an initial token grant from UNI the largest decentralized exchange provider as well as other DEFI DAOs, then in an active campaign period leading up to the token release allow for initial KYC. Since We need to validate some key actors that include students that are doing a graduate or undergraduate degree with major in Astronomy professors of Astronomy Univsersity Courses. Developers, authors and co-authors of open development astronomical software, including those of affiliated packages in Astropy. 

\subsection{Initial Token Distribution}
#This part so far just fun ideas but not so in favour of having an ILO or ICO etc., thinking the CONS are to stacked up against it but eventually 
Authors and co-authors Via the MNRAS sites and some form of Zero Knowledge Proof Validation will be able for each paper publishes list astroOD, that will be obtained from Treasury.

\subsection{Liquidity pools}

Liquidity pools for Astronomers , Travel Conferences, Observing, Teaching, these pools can be flexible but it is advised to be a percentage of PhD  students or some metric related to PhDs produced. 

\subsection{Career Development in Astronomy}

Over the time-scale of 5 years, incidentally about the average time it takes a new astronomy major to complete a PhD, the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchain's have stood-up to their promise to hold store of value. See Figure 1 and 2. These Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchains did not implode during the March 2020 flash-crash, probably motivated investors to seek liquidity across all markets in a COVID19 inspired pullback of main street.  Bitcoin ref(Satoshi Nakamoto) was born to be a store of value after the 2008 sub-prime morgage backed securities, credit default swap fiasco when the worlds largest banks were called to account causing the greatest financial crisis since the great depression of 1930's and is standing up now, when the FED, the US treasury and some central banks have offered to emit as much money as it takes to.
 
In this context it should be of no surprise that the Argentina Gemini membership in 2020 may even be under-threat depending on what the consorsium decides on behalf of Argentina. A situation since only a small fraction of the funds required for 2019 were delivered by the previous government and astronomers wages and subsidies are perceived to be undervalued. Unfortunately the news for science in general was not so great since the Ministry of Science was disbanded and funding to host international conferences in 2019 was put on a stand still. Although the new government did fund a new Ministry for Science, and Blockchain technology is considered a strategic area, there is actual little technology being adopted. If adequate funding is not forthcoming this could still signify retract in the educational scientific and technological potential of Argentina as an emerging country including a new brain drain wave for young-scientists, as talent settles overseas. 

This dire context above was contracted in complicity with loan requirements, exerted by the International Monetary Fund through loan obligations/conditioning that prioritized a creditor bonanza scheme based on a 70\% bank lending rate set by the PRO party coalition led by the ex-president of Paradise Paper's acclaim that ran a coalition government to full-term. 

Underlying this debt ridden situation, is a loaming world recession within a COVID-19 pandemic context with the cancellation of international Astronomical conferences, workshops and other meetings is taking place at a global scale: IVOA suspended its May Sydney Interop meeting and in Argentina the Observatory Astronomical of Cordoba (circa 1873) one of the first national scientific institutions with the Instituto de Astronomia Teorica y Experimental announced the suspension of the 2021 Friends of Friends workshop. 

It is argued that the current crisis, like the last major one that affected the research capacity of scientisits to conduct their work in Argentina was the 2001 economic crisis, when Argentina paid for being the "poster child of the IMF" with the greatest default in history and before that, when the Argentina Scientific output capacity was being determined down the barrel of a gun by the military junta and some home-grown scientists that would probably prefer to stay unnamed that seeminlgy justified this collateral damage (see Nature Levato paper, that was arrested in what appears a Mysogenic probably unrelated case.

In this context and given the fact that the half-life rate of Astronomy majors from US public universities has been in steep free-fall.  \cite{milo_2018} it is that the discussion of incentivizing using blockchain tokenomics. At the same time, government spending in the military industrial complex, banks, insurer and corporate bail-outs are at an all time high so as scientist it could be argued that it is our responsibility to add checks and balances with recognizably proven community technology. 
%
If such a model exists it is certain that data Feeds protocols will become an important part to allow to mitigate mistakes from central actors since the system must be largely transparent yet private when it needs to be. Our model would use Zero Knowledge Proofs and other blockchain primitives to safe-guard privacy of information of the individual yet also compensate or incentives the brave. 
   
The identification of elements or properties for the programmatic `tokenization' of an open development protocol for astronomy should not be limited or influenced by any one central authority or by the political economy of any one partner of IVOA or any other nation and should be based heavily on open source praxis paradigm. 
   
In Section INTRO we stated the motive and underlying potential of applying open development technology to astronomy. We detail with warp speed some crytographic primitives (Has functions, Merkle roots) and some basic protocols to establish a general model frame-work of Tokenomics, including staking or yield-farming incentive mechanics, time and value locked development fund release functions, and also discuss the implications of governance, etc,

\section{Decentralized Finance Key}

Liquidity is a necessary resource of any token model. Our Open Development Model requires liquidity. The patch offered here is to tie into the liquidity pools of the decentralized finance movement that we would hope to form a common token fund. Some parameters of the funding rate, principally by UNISWAP grant, would be determined by that community.

\section{Energy and Bitcoin}
The \cite{kar64} model or Energy Use function for civilizations might be a useful starting point to contextualize given the potential of wide-use of Bitcoin adoption. In the \cite{kar64} equation 1:

\begin{equation}
    (1+x)^t \approx e^{tx}
\end{equation}

Kardashev claims that even with a modest increase of only 1 \percent per year of energy consumption, a Phase 1 civilizations will be able to use all energy incident on the home planet (Earth, for us Humans) from the parent star, see Table 1. \cite{Sagan73} slightly re-define the zero point of the scale and introduce an information metric to accompany the energy metric. Table one shows what theoretical prediction of Energy Consumption by advance civilisation from phase 1 to phase 3, based on \cite{kar64}. Given a recent estimate of about 4.0 E16W use on the Earth the Earth's civilization. We may estimate that currently the Earth's Civilization is about 2-3 orders of magnitude from reaching phase 1. In \cite{Sagan73} alternate information metric a model is made on the information richness of any civilization. This can be represented in a Binary operations even a Binary Tree which share the Hash Function Structure. Interesting, the Bitcoin Network Ledger which contains transaction information of every single Bitcoin transaction may also be used between non-humans. This may be the sense of "Smart Contracts" by Nick Szabo. The Bitcoin Hash function could be taken to represent a function that could be a proxy for both the Energy Use and the Information in our model.

We consider that since astropy is the leading open developer toolkit for astronomical research reflected in the astropy  user and dev comits see \cite{ 2020ASPC..522..491T}, that it be used at t0 launchdate but details could even be revised later by governance.  The Etherium blockchain contains a type of smart contracts called NFT or non-fungable token.  This type of token is non-interchangable can be unique to preserve the notion of digital scarcity, and can be verified without any centralized organization required to authenticate it. These smart contracts can be used issue incentive rewards to nodes. A protocol build around 721 protocal includes POAP.xyz, ref(github address). This proof of attendance protcol can be used to validad the attendance of astronomical events, including virtual ones. The tokens can be exchanged for goods and services and soldon for fiat money.  


Data feeds will be entered into Oracles that will automatically via smart contracts provide incentive rewards to the node and user wallets.

\subsection{Hash Function Account}
We propose for any developer of Astropy core plus afiliated package models including co-authors are onboarded and in our model we apply the afilated package astropy Package astrobtc, recognizing the fact that Bitcoin has been the major asset class for the last 12 years that included several global crisis.

Astropy proving to revolutionize astronomical data-reduction collaboration and is channelled through the open development of astronomy project Astropy. It involves IVOA's 20 member institution was originally much smaller and conceived by its founding members to be a large fraternal virtual observatory working seamlessly in perfect collaboration with no imposed boundaries other than those of the ethical nature. Today it consists of mostly national VO members as well as three very important international members that include: the European Space Agency, the European VO and the UK VO. The national members are: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, \textit{Europe}, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. This `paper' proposes to open the discussion on the adoption of Block-chain technology for IVOA for the open development of astronomy. It is written in the context of long term flaws experienced in the current development model paradigm that results in less than efficient research inventive mechanism and cyclic funding crisis as well as possibly serendipitous COVID-19 type pandemic that may become more frequent.
%
Aside from some issues as illustrated below that would pausibly affects any 'closed' development model for astronomy, or one determined by powerful central actors, one based on open Blockchain technology should, on the other hand preferable gravitate to real open development via carefully thought-out and implemented incentive mechanisms to foster collaboration in a more efficient way and lay the path to unprecedented scientific discovery and innovation. It is in this context that I invite the reader to contemplate on the opening discussion of IVOA in the field of tokenomics. 
%
Our analysis focuses on the US public university research system, some limited experience on the IVOA system and the Argentine, Australian astronomical research system. 
   
   Strong motivation for this discussion is based on the facts that:
   
\begin{itemize}
       \item A dwindling half-life for the Astronomy and astrophysics PhD majors in US, Australian \& British (etc,) public university system meaning astronomy and astrophysics is loosing a main investment, its researchers.  
       
       \item Shortfalls caused by ciclic funding crisis that affect education institutions, scientific research facilities observed as acute funding restrictions, cutbacks and "government shutdowns" and/or inflation in national currencies, is the elephant in the room that must be addressed.
\end{itemize}
       
       
This paper explores the use of "Blockchain Technology" for more efficient and sustainable growth in Astronomy collaboration via real open development

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:5}
%
In this study, we set ourselves a task to discuss systemic issues that have hampered Open Development for Astronomy and propose an affiliated package to astropy AstroOD to build on the DEFI stack including the creation of wallets. This new package is required to be developed by the community and must be compatible with up-coming Python versions and be fully documented in a public repository. 
%
Future development will focus on the following three areas: incorporating
new features, improving documentation, and 
possible integration with tools for interactively analyzing features of development.

IAU and IVOA Astronomer data-base to validate loose KYC, coordinating contact with institutions.
