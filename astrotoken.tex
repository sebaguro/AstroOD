\begin{abstract}

An interoperability catalyst or (Open) Development driver based on (Open) blockchain legdger technology is considered for Astronomy \& Astrophysics Education, Research and Development from K-12 to tertiary-research level. Funding for AOD projects could be bootstraped from the decentralized finance movement or DEFI since DEFI appears to be a key idea of the open blockchain stack, so grant funding could be available for Open Development. The challenge then for the astronomical community is to to build a complimentary and sustainable store-of-value and value-added programmable incentive layer using open blockchain protocol standards within the existing structure and institutions. Motivation: the demonstrably steep decline in the half-life function of PhD Astronomy majors in public US universities and associated national systems or brain drain capital flight could be sufficient motivation given the resources it takes to produce a PhD major in astronomy, yet other barriers to open development are also examined. This paper proposes a path for on-boarding, and examined possible open development metrics that could be established by the community, automatically monitored and suitably refined through bodies like IVOA. 

%Open development metrics eg: Public Lectures by Astronomers from vetted institutions or number of telescope open-nights, H-index, GitHub code-pull/commits, N-body compute capability and usage, you-tube views, etc, graduate student number, could be used to constrain and engineering tokenomics to form the basis of protocol standards. Success of any protocol can be measured by the widespread use so a broad base of people interested in Astronomy but focus initially might be skewed to  public universities that confer astronomical PhD degrees, astronomical facility personal and the open development community in Astronomy. 
%Any alternative successful blockchain based model for the Open Development of Astropny is more likely to be based on the  Nakamoto 2008, Bitcoin protocol, (see whitepaper and standards  defined therein) as well as by other network blockchains that may be more complex. Protocols identified also broadly fall within the Decentralized Finance Movement (DEFI), since funding for Open Development via liquidity pools through grants could be effective. The DEFI movement has been analyzed in other works (REF) to show evidence of being a potential disruptor agent, to several industries including central bank/government issuance of FIAT currency. If the so-called 'sound money' proposition preported by DEFI advocates holds true and FIAT issuance is becoming debased, as shown by some studies, and access to funds for development of Astronomy in some regions also becomes more difficult then community `agreed' Open Development metrics could be used to help the alternative and complimentary funding mechanism of Open Development, based on DEFI liquidity to drive Astronomy, \textbf{our model assumption}. The antithesis that DEFI is a front-running industry that does not have much future for Open Development from which it was born and is not part of a future open protocol stack, a key open-ended question of this study. 

%The so-called Network effect for an open development token for astronomy can only be sustained if it has transaction use for its community.

%Some negative salient features to Open Development that may be present in the standard science funding scheme are analysed and potential metric proxies to Open Development proposed to be evaluated by the community, periodically. Risk factors at World; National; Provincial/State; University level;  etc., of governance are examined and select case-studies presented some of which have led to astronomical communities failing to enter or even maintain international collaborations on global mega-projects or have led to a so-called 'global' brain drain flight of Astronomy PhD majors to other industries, caused interruption of telescope facilities from normal operations or delayed construction of new facilities. 



%A function in smart-contracts could be used to delegate votes from individuals, in governance polls, an example of such code in a ERC20 contract that achieves this is given: UNISWAP-->

%For AstroOP, DEFI liquidity could be sought periodically from Decentralized Exchange(s) eg: Curve Finance, UNISWAP, and other DAO as considered by the community: The case however is that AstroOD be seed funded by DEFI, including UNISWAP Treasury and Education funds, \href{gitcoin grants} {https://gitcoin.co/grants/}, etc.,.  Some final use-case are presented including a case-study to include an NFT series to celebrate aniversary milestones in historic astronomical institutions. An example is given as an NFT series for the 150 year anniversary of the former Argentine National Astronomical Observatory or to mark the historical event of the 1912 Solar Eclipse expedition that set out to constrain Einstein's GTR, led by the then director of the Argentine National Observatory - Perrine 1912, with a message signed by Honorary IAU member and historian Santiago Paolantonio and another case-study of a conference NFT to fund prizes, travel grant unlocks., etc at the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Astronomy's (IATE) Friends-of-Friends Annual Meeting. 

% technology is a natural evolution of The Computer as proposed by Vitalic Buterein then it stands to reason given the tight connection between astronomy and technology that at least in the academic ecosystem such discussion should at least be had. 

%To the end of a Token for Astronomy, basic discussion of a road-map is had in this paper some identifiable issues as protocols for Astronomy "open-development" discussed. 

%Based on some generic smart-contracts. Initially this tech is proposed to have a direct influence on financing and execution of STEM careers  and to revert negative features of the current model that like the Half-life decay of Astronomy PhD majors as determined from statistical studies of US Public Universities. Since the US Public System is large and other similar systems based on it. The current Astronomical Development Model identified to be based on more Centralized Governance that relies on National Fiat Budget approvals, so a feature of our model is that a value-system based on Bitcoin and Ethereum who have each had ROI over the last decade superior to gold or most if not all other asset classes, that the old Meritocratic development Heuristic model often with "Elephant in the room" system failing such as in funding crisis, governement budget warfare, lawfare, debt and crisis that affect directly STEM research and such scientific development is defined to be 'closed' as opposed to 'open'. The old 'closed' heuristic often is often affected by cyclic economic crisis, currency devaluation, unemployment with real affects to the population, such a Heuristic of development challenged in this paper are based on political partism, centralized systems of power giving rise to the Military Industrial Complex, Petro-Dolar inspired drug wars (Chomsky, Understanding Power). Open Blockchain, anti-censoring technology is proposed and in particular through the perspective of thought of a new straw-mans-model as a natural evolution of Astronomy, piggybacked on Open Development Scientific Stack including the fast developing Decentralized Finance Movement, as at worst another useful system to incentivize real value development in Science by programming it to be more open.  

\end{abstract}



% Techniques based on artificial intelligence or machine learning has meant that precise data feeds or meta data eg: IRAF II standard, has shown the importance of synergy between new (Centralized) and optionally (decentralized) Scientific Research endeavour. 
%The current limitation of funding and crisis in Scientific development faced by the foot-soldiers or perhaps someone colloquially described "data slaves" motor of scientific technical development mostly brought to bear by Science Major Career graduates. Since Open Development rests on the Tenets of open source, and given a significant percentage of astronomers use Astropy for some data analysis so we propose an affiliated package of Astropy hereby called astroOD, to be used to create and manage individual wallets and transactions of Fungeble and Non-funagable tokens that serve the Open Developemnt of astronomy.  Although initially astropy users and developers will be onboarded, we propose a staged onboarding setup for successful implementation across the wider astronomical community. Many parts of the tokenomics model are taken directly from the so-called 'decentralized finance' movement that allows for the development of decentralized applications (DApps) on mobile devices to facilitate transactions, transparency and usage of the blockchain via astroOD Tx. This paper investigates possible protocol standards and discusses cross chain technologies via Oracles as a technology applicable to validate transactions and safeguard value via data feeds (Eg ADS searches, citations, etc.) and explores the concept of guardian nodes. General background conditions that motivate adoption by the astronomical community of such a system are presented as some model component parameters. Other technical details are omitted and not fixed but could be be soft or hard-wired after successful vetting from the governance component by means of periodic voting based on staked amounts A staking system is discussed to finance successful projects and  potential governance actors with initial staking claims including members seemingly outside of the astropy development community: Universities, National observatory facilities and institution, amateur astronomical associations, International Astronomy bodies (eg: IVOA, IAU), primary and secondary schooling bodies and other official and unofficial actors that promote astronomy research, education and outreach are discussed..

This white paper examines blockchain as a value optimization and interoperability agent for Astronomy Open Development (AOD). A comprehensive review paper of public and open blockchain ledger technology including its evolution: key primitives and protocols that lead to the so-called Nakamoto consensus solving the Byzantine Generals problem as defined by Lamport, XXX, and YYY 1972, is treated in  \cite{20d30b4efb014b21b7ab27f5218692ab} (and references therein). In Fig \ref{fig:narayanan} the key idea of the decentralized finance movement is added, adapting fig 1 of \cite{20d30b4efb014b21b7ab27f5218692ab}. Blockchain DEFI is identified as a complimentary grant funding source or boot-strapping AOD agent. However, once sufficient liquidity is added and a sufficient critical mass is reach it must be conceived AOD must continue from its own merits including operating in DEFI markets, to generate its own yield and fund itself and, ultimately the measure of success of blockchain will be determined by its specific use. On this point, Avid Avaryaran notes that the main challenge for wide-spread adoption of decentralized open blockchain ledger technology lies in the utility of use by existing users and institutions rather than in the necessity of creating new blockchain institutions. With this in mind we set out to identify and examine some salient issues that arise given the tight dependence of the nature of astronomy development and data-science through a tight coupling to the The Computer, our model heuristic.

The steeply falling half-life career function \cite{milo_2018} of US PhD Astronomy majors taken as a proxy, for the larger professional market could be sufficient motivation but so too more specific ad wider Astronomy \& astrophysics community. Other STEM communities may also find use in this white-paper since similar model/token parameters exist since Open Source and Open Development standard protocols are unifying and converging over different scientific disciplines and arguably sufficient motivation for Open Development can be found to exists within the literature [See HapMap project and its Open Source dependence for the human Genome Project, \cite{GITTER2008529} to prevent closed patenting licensing]

%In the last dozen years any community that built its value system on top of the Open Public Ledger stack that itself is based on The Bitcoin Standard Protocol would be wiser for it. In this paper, an attempt is made to bring to light into the debate interesting Blockchain primitives that have been largely unexplored but based on Open Source Development, to fork to existing protocols to promote interoperability through data-feeds, no doubt equivalent to  "ADS, Journal pub", IVOA protocols, etc identified in our case for Astronomy, to be seeded through "open-development", by the Community for the Community and through Layer 2 decentralized governance solutions.

%Potentially Blockchain technology for open development will continues to be more important so it could be argued that "Computer Systems" hardware and software will continue t evolve because of Blockchain, as shown in ASIC hardware development, increase in Pico Hashes per second surpassing Moore's Law and by the fact that Blockchain technology is is heralded by its proponent as disrupting the global financial system as evidenced since the first Bitcoin Block and through the last decade. 


%One of the problems of `Astropysics' which was an astronomy python package maintained by Eric Tollerud who is one of the OG of Astrpy, was that although projects were open there where many developers that maintained their own packages and had functions that often were similar or if not the same. This meant that less than efficient development of code could take place. 

%In an TCG IVOA meeting. Erik presented some evidence that IVOA development is sometimes a bit skewed to the big projects like ESA, astrogrid (UK), perhaps two of the most influential International Members of IVOA. These projects even design space-born telescope/instruments with multi-billion dollar buldgets. Unfortunately at times some of the standards that emerge are not exactly optimal for the communtiy most of which (70 percent, Tollerud) as shown in a recent poll work as data analysis using Python and the astronomical libraries of Astropy.

%Any complementary base layer model must be able to react to systemic risk factors to open development and sufficiently robust to build-up immunity to mitigate against counter-party risks that could be rooted in Financial; Health (Pandemics) ; or other political motivations that hinder Open Development in Astronomy. Some case-studies are discussed.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%
 The Antikythera mechanism was discovered in 1901 from the debris of a ship-wreck that were estimated to have occurred about two thousand years earlier. Computer \& Data Scientists may recognize it to be the first analogue computer mechanism or simply put: The Computer. \citet{Freeth2021} and other studies have demonstrated that the Antikythera mechanism was designed to solve astronomical problems based on a technology that rested on much support from ancient Greek Astronomers, including Hipparchus and Archimedes. The detailed scanning and modelling of the relic 'jig-saw puzzle' by \citet{freeth2021} confirm that it contained at-least three finely crafted rotating discs and more than thirty cogs that were designed, forged and crafted with adequate tolerances that were used to calculate and predict the positions of important astronomical sources including The Sun; The Moon; some planets, geo-localization, and the passing of time. These calculations were necessary for Navigation, Agriculture, scientific and cultural reasons. 
 
 The Ancient Greek astronomers had defined the magnitude logarithmic system and introduced concepts of limits and infinitesimals in geometry that would become the basis of differential calculus and numerical methods, tool-kits for astronomy that have proved to be of immense importance to its development.
 
 It is now known after a plethora of multi-disciplinary studies like \citet{Freeth2021} that after the decline of Ancient Greece this "Computer" was practically lost to most of the technological world, and only then in the fourteen century where comparable `sophisticated' mechanisms developed in Astronomical clock machinery developed in Europe. 
 
 Now, after more than two-thousand years Alan Turin (AT) is widely recognized to be a modern father of The Computer for his pioneering  work in the twentieth century that paved the foundations for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cryptography. 
 
Cryptography is the basis of Blockchain Ledger technology, a technology that as argued here has not been much explored for Astronomy Development, least as a potential catalyzing agent. Cryptography for Astronomy has mostly and only, been used as a tool for data compression, data permission (rights) and related data fidelity issues.


Interestingly,  `Machine-learning' and `Data Mining' Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used in an exponentially increasing number of published studies in astronomy peer-reviewed journals. Some studies reveal the physical source parameter space from large ensembles of data measurements of the observable parameter space, sources classified and astrophysical relations or laws that govern The Universe are also constrained. Due to the so-called data-tsunami AI may even be considered integral to Astronomy development since mega-survey's requirement must consider Velocity, Volume, Veracity, and Variety as necessary constraints for effective data-science requirements. High cadence astrophysics events for example through multi-messenger observations are required to study kilonova transient events that depend on real-time alert systems with AI techniques. So, it could be argued that AI is playing a fundamental role in the evolution of Astronomy, including gravitational wave astronomy. See also the Vera Rubin and SKA pipelines and the Section 3 on brokers. 

A corollary then arises that blockchain may also be useful for Astronomy (Open) Development, in an environment where the half-life function of PhD majors in astronomy is exponentially decreasing and projects are becoming much more reliant on team science.  Vera Rubin has only enough bandwidth for full data streams to 7 `community Brokers' which have been defined: Alerce, Ampel, Antares, Babamul, Fink, Lasair, Pitt-Google. Some of these brokers are lead by science teams from specialized areas of astrophysics. Could DEFI be used to fund dedicated Astropy community Brokers, rewarded via Oracles for soft-ware and data analysis contributions? Could blockchain also be used via an adequate governence model, like IVOA to mitigate other closed development issues.

\emph{Our goal then is to discuss Public Open Blockchain (cryptographic) technology as a base-layer stack for the Open Development of Astronomy.}

\section{Blockchain Review}
\label{sec:bc_review}
\cite{20d30b4efb014b21b7ab27f5218692ab} show insurmountable evidence as do many other authors therein that standard open blockchain protocols are much rooted in academic studies. Fig \ref{fig:narayanan} is an adaptation of their fig1 that includes the so-called Nakamoto consensus of 2008 with the addition of the key-idea of the "Decentralized Finance Movement". Also identified is the Automatic Market Making Technology which allows transaction swaps to occur, independent of any third-party that would otherwise require order book, sometime in the early 90's and gives rise to yield farming. We also include the UNISWAP governance token \href{https://github.com/Uniswap}{UNISWAP}, is  chosen as a potential grant source, since it was the first decentralized exchange (DEX) to include automatic market making technology that issued a governance air-drop. It is arguably one of the largest DEFI players whose treasury has more the 3 billion USD in reserve. Smart-contracts as coined by Nick Szabo are instrumental for Open Development protocols, a primitive not related to AI but to automatic conditional P2P transactions that do not require a third party mediator that could potentially automatically be executed within a sound value system like the Nakamoto consensus. 

Following Szabo in \href{https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html}{community vetted smart contract OD protocols} could integrate into base-layer applications like Oracles that could automatically injest data from third-party data-feeds like ADS publication rates within a research subject, field, key area,  or even institution.

Hitherto a successful AOD blockchain catalyst is most likely inextricably tied to the BITCOIN standard. In fact, in blockchain literature Bitcoin is referred to as the Nakamoto Consensus of blockchain, from the white-paper of \cite{nak2009} and subsequent Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP). A review can be found in \citet{Hansen2020Book}. Properties that for its selection as a valid  store of value system, include the Nakamoto block-size constraints that allow full-nodes to be run cheaply, even on a single PC and the Bitcoin supply function that is capped at 21,0000 is dependent on the miner rewards so in this context it is selected as part of the base-layer stack. Moreover, since its inception in 2009, after 12 years of price action (see Fig 1) it has proved to be a valid store-of-value with an ROI far superior to the USD standard that as noted herein appears to have had a high cost to AOD. However we note that although on short time-scales, (less than a year) the BTC asset is a volatile asset and since as Blockchain on-chain metrics support the idea that although the BTC/USD pairing is somewhat correlated to global financial markets and inherent volatility, a longer time-scales BTC volatility as measured by Cohen et al. and other authors, is falling. 

Although the latest BIP update at the end of 2021 includes smart contract capability through TAP-ROOT extension that was made scalable (to get around the 10-min block node confirmation) thanks to the earlier Lightning BIP and lightning that was built necessarily on-top of Segwit, the smart-contract Tx requirements for many OAD applications may incur high Tx costs so AOD must also be permissible to other Open blockchains that may at time of writing offer advantages in fuctionality including scalability and Tx costs. Market cap, ease of use, developer numbers, technology standards, cross chain metric analysis, as well as other indicators for other chains must be considered including Ethereum, DOT, LTC, Matic, as well as other blockchains. Many of these alt chains have helped in the technology development of Bitcoin network. The LTC developers for example developed Lightning, many have althriving developer communities, DApps and have billions of USD in locked liquidity from the Decentralized Finance Movement, that if indeed primitives most likely can be used for AOD and infused with DEFI grant funds. 

In order to gauge the issue of on-boarding and funding in this white paper we attempt to tackle the issue as identified by \cite{20d30b4efb014b21b7ab27f5218692ab} that the main challenge to open public blockchain use as a decentralized catalysing agent, lies in resolving implementation issues, so in Section XX we show a crude map of the Astronomical Observatory of Cordoba/IATE with its various block departments and educational programs including "Telescopio Itinerante", "Noche de los Museos", "Museum del Observatorio Astronomico", "Library", "FOF workshop". We recall that the IATE-OAC has over 80 staff including, permanent academic staff, graduate and undergraduate students,  CPA (Technical and auxiliary staff). The largest proportion of include academic research. We identify for our open protocol, to incentivize academic capital flows through different blocks since we  consider this to be healthy and pervasive to AOD despite and to offset the funding challenges of the programs.

Smart contract as coined by Nick Szabo have little if any to do with AI but more in the sprit of automatic conditional P2P transactions or more succinctly put do not require a third party mediator and can be automatically executed within a sound value system, say the Nakamoto consensus. According to a \href{https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html}{community vetted smart contract protocols} that could integrate into base-layer applications like Oracles from third-party data feeds, like publication rate within a research subject or field or an institution. 

Governance protocols also use smart-contracts and most likely will be a part of any successful AOD infrastructure, since the voice of the community is efficiently heard and actions decided via voting, by the community. Prediction market protocols could also be used to help AOD mitigate against stochastic ill-effects that may cause restrictions to Open development caused by other status-quo 'hard-wired" funding mechanisms. For example in Sec XXX we examine the TFlop computational issue facing Argentine Astronomers (mostly N-body, and Grid), in which HPC Argentine Research Scientist are at a disadvantage since barriers to the floating TFlop/ARG (Peso) and delays of years in time-scale put Argentine Astronomers on a very uneven playing-field. In Fact it had been recently said in the Jornadas de Computation de Astronomia de Argentina, in which the IATE invited members across all the astronomical institutions national insitutions in a workshop that pooling resources is important, because many of the grant costs go to UPC, air-conditioning, network infraestructure so that when the project subsidy money comes in, researchers have to scale back to front-up these costs or depend on external (closed-to-others) collaborations with their own infrastructure, perhaps that have not devalued as much against the USD. In Fig 2 we reproduce the historic global crisis function of nation states that depicts an exponential increase in crisis instances during periods when `sound money' was  unfamiliar to most governments of the world. It is concurrently noted that these periods affected and retarded astronomy open developement since in those times other more essential funding priorities dominate including using available funding to cover the bare essential necessities of the population. We emphasize from this figure that during the Bretton Woods accorded period, or the period within the de-marked broken blue lines that the occurrence of financial crisis was approximately a global minimum. 

Could the Nakamoto consensus as the go-to store of value or sound money base protocol and subsequent BIPs usher-in a new period of stability and even innovation for OAD in Astronomy? 

In Fig 3 we reproduce the empirical half-life function for astronomy and astrophysics PhD majors as well as other STEM fields within the US Public University System. It is clear that this figure is shows alarming exponential rate of decline.  In Section \ref{sec:btc2}, discussion of the current and historical situation that has underpinned the negative effects of Astronomy development with examples are discussed. In Section  \ref{sec:btc3}, some blockchain primitives and protocols are identified, selected to complement Open Astronomy Development.  In Section \ref{sec:btc4} a simple idea of implementation and on-boarding for our model of Astronomy education/development and research via open development is proposed via Astropy, the leading Open Developer community tool-kit by Astronomers for astronomers. In Sec. \ref{sec:btc5} conclusions drawn and some discussion on a possible future course of action plus an NFT case-study to celebrate 150 years of the Observat\'orio Astron\'omico de Cordoba, the former National Argentine Observatory. 

\section{Open Astronomy development}
\label{sec:btc2}

In this Section we propose 5 use-cases for blockchain as case-studies. Chosen across a wide base-line of variety for Astronomy development at the OAC-IATE identified as infrastructure for (i) funding of a new telescope-system, (ii) 'telescopio itinerante', (iii) re-value historical patrimony, (iv) grant stable coin liquidity pool for granted research projects, that is PICT-PIP, (v) Broker for Vera Rubin Surveys. Although case-types identified mostly focus on  the OAC-IATE, due to regularity of funding crisis that affect OAD at the macroscopic global scale, so in this context in this section related salient issues are examined including the so-called global brain drain or haemorrhage. In Subsection \ref{btc2:sec:sub:half} proxy metrics for AOD are proposed that might go someway to restore historic half-life rate function of Astronomy PhD majors in Public US Universities and associated AOD systems to be consierded. 

Vera Rubin Surveys 10,000 alerts provided every 39 seconds. Need short time-scale science. Semantically rich alert. Triggering Difference Imagine source, 82 KB per alert means 5 GB per s per full stream. Sixty Second from read-out information needs to get to the Broker system, at least 5 full streams to alert brokers.   For example  Jakob Nordin of AMPEL, requests from the community a standard processing framework for Legacy Very Rubin data, a standard that would enable processing of data-sets irrespective of broker identically and as efficiently as possible, at the moment this is a challenge.  Mathew Graham of Babamul considers that traditional approaches to handle event streams are sub-optimal and sees for backend work a decentralized network of low-cost components employing commodity AI accelerators and reusable models plus an in-use science data platform for information management that any group can set up on their own at-scale broker for less than 1 USD per day, using Raspberry PI + USB TPUs (4 TOPS), optimal for deep learning models.  Federated Learning for example, which is what Babamul is attempting that is completely open sourced, could well complement open block chain protocols implementation. Several issues exist for federated learning systems including single-point failure type issues, but also a suitable incentive mechanism to mitigate against data falsification. Blockchain-enabled federated learning can solve these issues as described in 


\subsection{Half-life function}
\label{btc2:sec:sub:half}

The exponentially falling half-life function for Astronomy majors in US public universities is an alarming metric. It is now about 3 years and has been dropping exponentially since about 1970 or about the same time the US withdrew unilaterally from the International Bretton-Woods accords that tied the 'price of one USD' to an allocation of gold. The desertion PhD function could be considered a global hemorrhage of 'grey matter' or capital flight away from astronomy open development.

\emph{In an open development model scientific contributions from the community should be guaranteed, valued and enhanced in a P2P application-layer sense via a more robust gold2.0-standard programmed by the community through open governance blockchain protocols.}


\subsection{The Merging of Open-Source protocols}

Both AI and Blockchain cryptographic come from Open Source community and both may actually be necesary for the evolution of Astronoomy. To help resolve the issue that is presented by the Data Tsunami, on building deep learning models for large data streams, brokers are necessary, and must be as efficient as possible. For surveys like the Vera Rubin the tasks are complex from cross matching to managing to the community deep learning models to test and refine. Data-rights proprietary periods although have been dropping over time and are now around 6-12 months obviously provide science-team members with a considerable time-sensitive advantage and know-how first mover advantage.  Given the scenario depicted in \label{btc2:sec:sub:half} of increasing number of astronomer PhDs within larger team projects, and considering as reported by the Bambanunu broker team, for deep federated learning decentralized computer infrastructure is expected to be more ideal than large centralized data-centres for many types of problems.  Astronomers that don't have access to such infrastructure to train a models either with their own machines and drawn know-how or are not part of a federated deep learning model will find it more difficult to stay competitive. Blockchain technology could help here too in incentivizing colaboration.   

How to merge Open Blockchain technology to Open Source academic/(community) stack of astronomy protocols via the: Nakamoto Consensus?

In the last decade Open-Source projects in Astronomy have burgeoned and become somewhat unified. 'Astropy' with its community affiliated and coordinated packages has become the leading community repository mine.  One of the reasons the community got behind one project was that many packages offered similar functions and the maintenance costs scaled with the number of version. Some methods may have been more optimal, so a standard system evolved that now maintains the code-base in the community. In Astropysics and other early python repositories for Astronomy the developers recognized with other members of the community that community maintained code repositories was key to development of Open-Source software.

It is contemplated in this White Paper perhaps some-what heuristically that like The Computer that has continued to be a fundamental tool for astronomical problem solving, Blockchain that is itself derived from open source community efforts warrants a more complete analysis by the comunity for AOD. Although most astronomers use Astropy amongst other tools, no block chain modules yet exist on Astropy so we on balance of a community coordinated or affiliated package, consider AstroOD as a coordinated package, since interoperability of coordination is required with other actors and agents of facilities including the IVOA 

\subsection{Funding Framework}

Here we identify possible AOD funding frameworks, all from crypto asset classes.  It is argued that Decentralized Finance (DEFI) based grant funding is identified currently as the most useful.

Figure 1 shows the financial crisis recorded about the Bretton Woods accords, when US unilaterally pulled out.

Before Bitcoin some initial attempts of a digital currency yielded successful prosecutions by the US Fed court system vaguely under the term: 'Counterfit' of the legal tender or of the Fiat currency system.

\section{Early protocols}
\label{sec:btc3}

Early store-of-value protocols preceding BITCOIN are discussed in Chaum (1983), Chaum, Fiat Naor (1989), Rivest and Shamir (1997). Haber and Stornetta (1991) discuss the notion as an important driver for global scientific, social and cultural growth that with 5G promises to rival the historic highs of 18 \% of World annual GDP of the likes not seen since the first industrial revolution (Walden et al. CTO of NOKIA, Bell's 2018 speech).

If Bitcoin/Blockchain is a decentralized technology, its use as a store-of-value for Astronomy must complement decentralized education research, and development. This is embodied in the so-called term: "Open Development".

 
However, in the first decade of the 21st century came Bitcoin, published anonymously by Satashi Nakamoto in 2008.  In the first block, see Figure 1: is a reference to the New York Times article that claimed The then U.K. chancelor was considering a second round of Bail-Outs for the biggest British Banks. Satoshi, probably a pseudonym. According to some analysis represents the work from mostly one person (MOOC BlockChain, Princeton). Never-the-less Bitcoin and it's Blockchain network BTC appears to have generated a store of value over other asset classes so it could be argued that so far, in the time-frame of years in it's first decade of existence the Store-of-value proposition appears to be a sound one.

Recognizably in shorter time-frames (days or even months) BTC volitility is higher. Some authors argue that as an asset class since it is measurably young it is also tends to be more speculative that should become less volatile in about as long a time-scale (years, decade), asset (Antonopoloulos)? Energy Usage is also discussed here in Section XX. 
 
BTC as a world reserve still appears to be partly correlated to other global financial markets. A recent example is the Covid19 black Thursday pandemic that in March 2020 saw BTC price drop by more than 30\% in only a few hours. This appeared to be triggered by the Black Thursday liquidity crisis that swept the much larger global financial markets and the reactions of central bank governments to it as did the Omicron crash of December 2021. The March 2020 crash coincided with a crash in global equity markets that saw stocks suffer the worse losses since The Great Depression" and iconic corporations were "bailed out", like Hertz after a record number of unemployed, filed for unemployment benefits in the US. After about a fortnight, like many blue-chip stocks, bailed out by the US FED via Repo, corporate bond offers, and share buy-backs the BTC recovered almost instantly. Against other asset classes including gold and USD, BTC appears to be in the short scales at worst, as volatile. 
 
Bitcoin as a technology to solve several problems faced by earlier digital currencies. Having no single point of failure meant law suits can not be used to persecute anonymous creators. This adds to network security by processing Hash functions which is adjusted on a two week basis. Some authors, including Andreas Antonopoulos believe Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains have the potential to revolutionize open development in science and technology and with 5G roll-out promise unprecedented levels of growth of over 18 percent per year, not seen since the first industrial revolution Waldon, M.  Fig needtoinsertfigure adapted from Walden et al. shows the world GDP as a function of time. These technologies were born out of academia, the occupy wall-street and anonymous movements as a direct response to the 2008 financial crisis that saw a global slump in the world GDP based on the US sub-prime financial crisis  that included a drop in US GDP by 30 \% sustained over several years.
 
Programmable money is not exclusively relevent to human beings but also to machines as particapative actors. Hardware evolution is also tied to open development, as seen in the evolution of specialized hardware architecture for Proof Of Work (POW) HASH Function calculations that is developing Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICS) to mine Bitcoin blocks. It could be argued that these developements have outpaced Moore's law.  Wrights Law suggests that the for every percentage increase in the cumulative distribution function of production in any industry equates to a fixed percentage increase in the efficiency of production. So hardware has evolved from CPU intense through to graphic processing units (GPU) and  Application Specific Integrated Circuit  (ASICS), \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0052669}. A successful model for Astronomy and Astrophysics Open Development would do good to tie metrics of Open Production into the protocol as well as the appropriate incentive mechanism.       

Open Blockchains are uncensored so a data protocol standard of best practice through governance could be cross validated from an information criterion perspective that includes Oracle feeds for Open Development.  Oracles that receive feeds are penalized if they predict incorrect probability distributions of events or Facts for Astronomy Development prediction markets. 

\section{Early Blockchains}
Turing complete programming languages like ETH (ref to Vitallic) but unlike BITCOIN  (refernce to Satoshi) have loops and are able to iterate infinitely.  Bitcoin was purposely built to be much simpler, it has proven in just over a decade (see Fig \ref{fig:btc}) to be a good store of value when compared to the USD. It does not deal naively with Smart Contracts. Although Ethereum can do much of what Bitcoin can, its scope is far larger than simply being a digital, decentralized global store of value mechanism of human transactions. Whereas Bitcoin was primarily designed to be a P2P form of electronic cash, the Ethereum blockchain was designed to also function as a “World Computer”. There are many excellent sources in the Literature on this but we will concentrate on Atributes of a Token for Astronomy in the Section below and describe aspects of our model.

\section{Indexing Open Production and Development}

A community defined and validated AOD system could be used to evaluate preferred funding channels including node validation via incentives Txn types. Such a system could be periodically revised by the community with community governance protocols that ideally would respect yet complement existing structures in a self-consistent decentralized manner. IVOA could be the perfect example with 19 Nation State member countries and 4 international members. These metrics could be used to direct and supply liquidity for the Open Development of Astronomy. As seen in Fig Seffanni. national governments that spend a larger percentage of GDP towards science and technology also on average have higher GDP growth rates (in USD). So this could be a weighting factor metric. See equtation1. Reciprocal percentage of total GDP towards science could be a constructed normalization parameter. So too could total debt to GDP public debt.  An example is the Maker ERC231 ETH governance token that itself control a  pseudo-decentralized US stable coin bank, DAI, over-collateralised that has remained 1 USD for several years despite the BTC market varience.  On the question of whether a special token need minting. The pros and cons need to be carefully studied by the community. For example WETH and WBTC are stable tokens that are on native ETH but allow interconectivity between chains. A similar system occurs with the price issuance of DAI via Maker. It is an important element of DEFI and governence that is included in Figure 2.   

DEFI protocols and more general community may have some motivation to provide decentralized funding for astronomy Open Development. First, Open development protocols could insure existing methods and procedures mauy also be applicable to the Open Development of Astronomy Community. Both  based on Open Source technology, that follow the Lindy effect.
 
 \section{Model Attributes of a Token for Astronomy}
\label{sec:btc4}
There are certainly advantages if the community has its own token. But there are also disadvantages. RSA Ecliptic Curve Algorithm, asymetric hash function, Blind, Schnor Signatures, Merkle Trees, ZKP,  WEB3, Multi-sig, Cross chain, mixing - Privacy. 

\subsection{Block Validation}
\label{subsec: validator}
Blockchain Validators and Nodes. ERC20 Protocalls like GRT ERC   

\href{https://defipulse.com/}{DEFI$\;$ PULSE} pulse is a list of all the liquidity that is tied into DEFI. There is over 77.77 $\times 10^{9}$ USD locked in DEFI. The UNISWAP treasury has in excess of 3 billion dollars. These treasury funds are available via grants programs that Astronomy Open Development protocols should have access to.

In this Section, a toy model for the open development of Astronomy based on open Blockchain technology is presented. An attempt is made to sketch out ingredients and methods of a `successful' model. Some elemental principals as voted by governance should be voted at different stages calibration proposals. For argument sakes in this model we follow the UNISWAP snapshot community, where there are different instances of governance. We also have a treasury funds, and the like.  through governance solutions. The UNISWAP model, to date is one of the largest decentralized exchange, has many developers working for it, was the first massive airdrop token of blockchain value, so is essentially decentralized in our assumption. The funds for this Paper come from DEFI, from the NOVA node of the IVOA-EXEC committee for Argentina. Some fundamental actors are identified and their functionality with the model sketched out. This paper does not pretend to discuss in strict technical details the finer points of the implementation of such model and parameters therein, but does make reference to some basic cryptographic primatives including Merkle Trees, Zero-knowledge proofs, cross chain protocals, etc. that offer promising solutions and could certainly be considered to be incorporated during Improvement Proposals directed by the community periodically. The paper does not delve into technical details of some blockchain procedures like mixing to maintain secure personal and private information but of all actors but pretends to highlight some core model features to be followed up by future authors but obviously  locked value will naturally flow to the more useful protocols.  
 
The only condition to participate is bonafide scientific curiosity for Astronomy so sufficient incentive methods need to be developed to entice value-added interaction with the astronomy blockchain via Decentralized Block Chain Applications, (DAps) as programmable parameters that can be set by the Model's governance component albeit individual minority actors. 

%This part examines a type of Model. The ICO era based on the Ethereum smart contracts bubble that burst aside from rthe egulatory issues about Securities that was mostly based on near useless speculative tokens must be avoided by any AOD bonafide . It looks at some main or speculive  I would not be in favour of an ICO, I think founds are complimentary and as such must come forom existing DEFI protocol pools. But the Community must decide this. However, For the sake of simplicity the following three `actors' are identified as founding governance members: International Virtual Observatory Alliance, the  Astropy community and authors of referred peer reviewed journals weighted by their h-index, the International Astronomy Union etc. Parameters such as the weight of each should be set soon and be discussed by the community and there could even be a switch or that must be voted on according to community established acoords. For example astropy community. A type of switch could be voted for to change the relative percentage of votes.UNISWAP for exmaple is the first governence token that inclduded the AMM liquidity  The reward will be the AstroOD Token, since the wallet creation, blockchain exploder and DApp python tools and protocols are unified by the proposed affiliated package of astropy. This parameter could be considered to as a proportionality of any initial coin distribution function. But we would be against this and think programs need to start from the ground-roots up, providing liquidity and rewarding Tx were useful (community validaded) Tx occur. On Balance an initial token distribution or ICO has drawbacks and so our model draws on existing liquidity pools from the DEFI Space.

Over 70 percent of Astronomers use  Astropy and recent paper in preparation show a promising metric in developer community as the community developer toolkit for Open Source code, that with VO software makes up the majority toolkit of astronomers barring some HPC computing for N-body simulations. Many astronomers probably agree to say these would be the recognized go-to  Astronomy Software and Development so the Astropy Community onboarding, usefulness would be advantages to the Open Development Astronomy model (here-after ODM) of Astronomy as proposed. Affiliated package authors could be validated and offered a period to open a wallet and partake in governence DAO. An affiliated package to Astropy is selected to generate private public SHA256 pairs and the generated funds will be locked by the Community 70 percent to Developers. 

No initial coin offering is neesary as this would be deemed a securtiy and may violate some Legal Juristicitions that we argue for Open Development must be lawful yet, at the same time decentralized means if a majority want and if safeguards are put in place, ie truelly decnentralized nodes, not INFURA WEB three but above. So recognizing `challanges' that Open Protocol must face and converging on Wrights Law of the CDF of Astronomy Developement we appeal to DEFI grant protocols to fund our development. 


The AstroOD package 

We propose an AstroOD coordinated package \textcolor{red} github ref. that periodically receives data-feeds on AstroOD on collects basic statistics of packages being used and is correlated to ADS Main-Text query and ORCID query. A possibility is to build a SubGraph to program as an Oracle on UNISWAP. UNISWAP liquidity    Anyone in the Astropy community can create key pairs to be used as Smart Contract accounts. The program using RSA, and blind signature for privacy. The package will include a functional wallet, with multi signature, multi currency and multiple accounts. This will be the basis of deployment of “Smart Contracts”, as a concept was introduced in 1995 by Nick Szabo, who described Smart Contracts as “a set of promises,
specified in digital form, including protocols within which these parties perform.

AstroOD package will have to be built to implement the use of Oracles, to connect the community to the blockchain space. Oracles manage feeds of information are not put into the native blockchain due to scalability or privacy issues, etc but to other Chains.  Oracles are more focused on price-feed data for crypto asset prediction markets but with DEFI burgeoning and necessity the Oracle inputs are becoming more diversified.  The Oracle Problem 4 promises” (Szabo, 1996). 

Feeds for Oracles would include ADS-NASA, ArchieX ., etc,  to validate information that can be used to automatically set parameters in the model. The weights could be voted on by IVOA representatives.

If the  model truly represents an open blockchain then anyone can participate and be offered rewards as incentive in pursuit of open astronomy. It is obviously important that protocol standards be defined and a body like IVOA could be instrumental in helping to define them with the Astropy community, for example. That body could take into account validaded economic considerations like inflation of national currencies., crisis, etc. Staked AstroOD tokens can be awarded using a 'competative' awards scheme program to Secondary School Teachers, Plenetarium guides, thesis graduate students etc. that work to teach astronomy. All must have oportunity to receive incentive rewards for their valid contributions including for example validated University students and volunteers that mount Open-Day/Night activity for the public, etc., All should receive incentive rewards for their contribution since sacrificing their time in sharing knowledge to allow others opportunities should be rewarded as it is clearly in pursuit of Open Development. Weightings for these activities can be set periodically by the governance component with mandatory revision periods, and clauses if they change too abruptly. An option is to follow MakerDAO governance models, with funds from Treasury. Unfortunately political, financial, health  crisis cause by rampant financial speculation and the like, will probably not be solved by Central Bank Digital Currencies, as these are essentially still centralised institutions on a blockchain.  Often during these crisis outreach and educational activities are the first casualty of open development, as are essential and scares resources for Public University and National Institute research bodies. In the case of the creation of events, the governance model will award staked token holder to provide credit for future open development. Authors who publish papers also may claim awarded tokens and trade them too?

\subsection{Digital Open Ledger Technology}

\subsection{ERC 721 }

ERC 721 tokens are an ETH standard token contracts that are Non-Fungible Token (NFT), ie they are unique and indivisible or in other words can be used to identify a unique event, object or condition. This type of Token may be used on platforms that offer digital collectibles, access keys, lottery tickets, numbered seats for concerts, sports matches or academic meetings, for example best "student" poster prizes in conferences, etc. 

ERC 721 tokens may have different values from one another although derived from the same Smart Contract base, due to its age, rarity often iconized by its unique visual artistry (appearance).

The uint256 variable or called tokenId, so for any ERC-721 Contract, the pair contract address, uint256 tokenId must be globally unique. Said that a dApp can have a "converter" that uses the tokenId as input and outputs an image of something cool, like zombies, weapons, skills or amazing kitties!


With PAOP protocol ERC721 SMart Contract Non-Fungable Tokens can be issued on demand if needbe. These digital collectables will be sold on a Dex funded exchange, to provide liquidity to further Scientific-Cultural usecases.

i) A PhD scholarship holder has run out of PhD Funding 
ii) A Group that is working in some country has had the USD devalued and the subsidy payments are late, and they are applying for some tokens and offer in exchange a collaborate NFT to be published in the acknolodgements of the paper.
iii) A group of astronomers, technicians, students,  are building an observatory in a advantageous site in a poor country. 

\subsection{Tokenisation}

Since centralized regulation that at some stage may undermine public open Blockchain science development and by weighing-up pros/cons between POW and POS consusus, of the Table blockpros/cons as well as from recognizing the 12 year dominance of BITCOIN we choose to follow governance model tokenisation, adopted by  companies like "Shape-Shift" a XXX billion USD companies that has become completely Tokenized. Any system must be able tp use Bridges even to different chains. 

Its xxx workers were each given some tokens as where select members from the community. 

A possible route of course is to solicit an initial token grant from UNI the largest decentralized exchange provider as well as other DEFI DAOs, then in an active campaign period leading up to the token release allow for initial KYC. Since We need to validate some key actors that include students that are doing a graduate or undergraduate degree with major in Astronomy professors of Astronomy Univsersity Courses. Developers, authors and co-authors of open development astronomical software, including those of affiliated packages in Astropy. 

\subsection{Initial Token Distribution}
#This part so far just fun ideas but not so in favour of having an ILO or ICO etc., thinking the CONS are to stacked up against it but eventually 
Authors and co-authors Via the MNRAS sites and some form of Zero Knowledge Proof Validation will be able for each paper publishes list astroOD, that will be obtained from Treasury.

\subsection{Liquidity pools}

Liquidity pools for Astronomers , Travel Conferences, Observing, Teaching, these pools can be flexible but it is advised to be a percentage of PhD  students or some metric related to PhDs produced. 

\subsection{Career Development in Astronomy}

Over the time-scale of 5 years, incidentally about the average time it takes a new astronomy major to complete a PhD, the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchain's have stood-up to their promise to hold store of value. See Figure 1 and 2. These Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchains did not implode during the March 2020 flash-crash, probably motivated investors to seek liquidity across all markets in a COVID19 inspired pullback of main street.  Bitcoin ref(Satoshi Nakamoto) was born to be a store of value after the 2008 sub-prime morgage backed securities, credit default swap fiasco when the worlds largest banks were called to account causing the greatest financial crisis since the great depression of 1930's and is standing up now, when the FED, the US treasury and some central banks have offered to emit as much money as it takes to.
 
In this context it should be of no surprise that the Argentina Gemini membership in 2020 may even be under-threat depending on what the consorsium decides on behalf of Argentina. A situation since only a small fraction of the funds required for 2019 were delivered by the previous government and astronomers wages and subsidies are perceived to be undervalued. Unfortunately the news for science in general was not so great since the Ministry of Science was disbanded and funding to host international conferences in 2019 was put on a stand still. Although the new government did fund a new Ministry for Science, and Blockchain technology is considered a strategic area, there is actual little technology being adopted. If adequate funding is not forthcoming this could still signify retract in the educational scientific and technological potential of Argentina as an emerging country including a new brain drain wave for young-scientists, as talent settles overseas. 

This dire context above was contracted in complicity with loan requirements, exerted by the International Monetary Fund through loan obligations/conditioning that prioritized a creditor bonanza scheme based on a 70\% bank lending rate set by the PRO party coalition led by the ex-president of Paradise Paper's acclaim that ran a coalition government to full-term. 

Underlying this debt ridden situation, is a loaming world recession within a COVID-19 pandemic context with the cancellation of international Astronomical conferences, workshops and other meetings is taking place at a global scale: IVOA suspended its May Sydney Interop meeting and in Argentina the Observatory Astronomical of Cordoba (circa 1873) one of the first national scientific institutions with the Instituto de Astronomia Teorica y Experimental announced the suspension of the 2021 Friends of Friends workshop. 

It is argued that the current crisis, like the last major one that affected the research capacity of scientisits to conduct their work in Argentina was the 2001 economic crisis, when Argentina paid for being the "poster child of the IMF" with the greatest default in history and before that, when the Argentina Scientific output capacity was being determined down the barrel of a gun by the military junta and some home-grown scientists that would probably prefer to stay unnamed that seeminlgy justified this collateral damage (see Nature Levato paper, that was arrested in what appears a Mysogenic probably unrelated case.

In this context and given the fact that the half-life rate of Astronomy majors from US public universities has been in steep free-fall.  \cite{milo_2018} it is that the discussion of incentivizing using blockchain tokenomics. At the same time, government spending in the military industrial complex, banks, insurer and corporate bail-outs are at an all time high so as scientist it could be argued that it is our responsibility to add checks and balances with recognizably proven community technology. 
%
If such a model exists it is certain that data Feeds protocols will become an important part to allow to mitigate mistakes from central actors since the system must be largely transparent yet private when it needs to be. Our model would use Zero Knowledge Proofs and other blockchain primitives to safe-guard privacy of information of the individual yet also compensate or incentives the brave. 
   
The identification of elements or properties for the programmatic `tokenization' of an open development protocol for astronomy should not be limited or influenced by any one central authority or by the political economy of any one partner of IVOA or any other nation and should be based heavily on open source praxis paradigm. 
   
In Section INTRO we stated the motive and underlying potential of applying open development technology to astronomy. We detail with warp speed some crytographic primitives (Has functions, Merkle roots) and some basic protocols to establish a general model frame-work of Tokenomics, including staking or yield-farming incentive mechanics, time and value locked development fund release functions, and also discuss the implications of governance, etc,

\section{Decentralized Finance Key}

Liquidity is a necessary resource of any token model. Our Open Development Model requires liquidity. The patch offered here is to tie into the liquidity pools of the decentralized finance movement that we would hope to form a common token fund. Some parameters of the funding rate, principally by UNISWAP grant, would be determined by that community.

The Etherium blockchain contains a type of smart contracts called NFT or non-fungable token.  This type of token is non-interchangable can be unique to preserve the notion of digital scarcity, and can be verified without any centralized organization required to authenticate it. These smart contracts can be used issue incentive rewards to nodes. A protocol build around 721 protocal includes POAP.xyz, ref(github address). This proof of attendance protcol can be used to validad the attendance of astronomical events, including virtual ones. The tokens can be exchanged for goods and services and soldon for fiat money.

Astropy proving to revolutionize astronomical data-reduction collaboration and is channelled through the open development of astronomy project Astropy. It involves IVOA's 20 member institution was originally much smaller and conceived by its founding members to be a large fraternal virtual observatory working seamlessly in perfect collaboration with no imposed boundaries other than those of the ethical nature. Today it consists of mostly national VO members as well as three very important international members that include: the European Space Agency, the European VO and the UK VO. The national members are: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, \textit{Europe}, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. This `paper' proposes to open the discussion on the adoption of Block-chain technology for IVOA for the open development of astronomy. It is written in the context of long term flaws experienced in the current development model paradigm that results in less than efficient research inventive mechanism and cyclic funding crisis as well as possibly serendipitous COVID-19 type pandemic that may become more frequent.
%
Aside from some issues as illustrated below that would pausibly affects any 'closed' development model for astronomy, or one determined by powerful central actors, one based on open Blockchain technology should, on the other hand preferable gravitate to real open development via carefully thought-out and implemented incentive mechanisms to foster collaboration in a more efficient way and lay the path to unprecedented scientific discovery and innovation. It is in this context that I invite the reader to contemplate on the opening discussion of IVOA in the field of tokenomics. 
%
Our analysis focuses on the US public university research system, some limited experience on the IVOA system and the Argentine, Australian astronomical research system. 
   
   Strong motivation for this discussion is based on the facts that:
   
\begin{itemize}
       \item A dwindling half-life for the Astronomy and astrophysics PhD majors in US, Australian \& British (etc,) public university system meaning astronomy and astrophysics is loosing a main investment, its researchers.  
       
       \item Shortfalls caused by ciclic funding crisis that affect education institutions, scientific research facilities observed as acute funding restrictions, cutbacks and "government shutdowns" and/or inflation in national currencies, is the elephant in the room that must be addressed.
\end{itemize}
       
       
This paper explores the use of "Blockchain Technology" for more efficient and sustainable growth in Astronomy collaboration via real open development

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:5}
%
In this study, we set ourself a task to discuss systemic issues that have hampered Open Development for Astronomy and propose an affiliated package to astropy AstroOD to build on the DEFI stack including the creation of wallets. This new package is required to be developed by the community and must be compatible with up-coming Python versions and be fully documented in a public repository. 
%
Future development will focus on the following three areas: incorporating
new features, improving documentation, and 
possible integration with tools for interactively analyzing features of development.

IAU and IVOA Astronomer data-base to validate loose KYC, coordinating contact with institutions.
