# AstroOD A straw-person model of a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System base-layer for the Open Development of Astronomy: Education and Research}

Description:

This project aims to develop an alternative funding protocol for the Open Development
of Astronomy and astrophyscs based on open block-chain ledger technology, as a straw-persons model.

The main motivation is to stop the hemorrhage or the "brain-drain' of
Astronomy and Astrophysics grey-matter, as measured over the last
fifty years in public universities, when the 'large' US Public University
'Market' is taken as a proxy, but it also aims to foster complimentary
open development and innovation for Astronomy based on decentralized
governance.


It attempts to be a network, that could be run on an "coordinated astropy package", subgraph tech etc.,  that validates use of astropy modules that are
part of publications, and other Open Development metrics etc as an alternative funding source based on the "Decentralized Finance
Movement" liquidity. 

Contributing: Of course contributors are necessary and are encouraged to help strength the paper, or help with astropy affiliated discussion, development of metrics, etc

Internal notes (may be still required)

Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Contributing: Contributors are encouraged to help better the paper, or help with astropy affiliated discussion and development.

Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.
