Blockchain for the Open Development of Astronomy
This project is an idea of an alternative funding standard 
for the Open Developement of Astronomy. The main motiviation
is the sharp half-life index drop over the last thirty-years
of Astronomy PhD majors in Public Universities when the US system
is taken as a proxy.
